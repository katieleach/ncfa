Asset,Description
Atmosphere,The atmosphere is formed of gases (such as oxygen) and processes (such as temperature regulation) which support a number of ecosystem services.
Habitats,"Habitats provide nearly all ecosystem services in some way. They can be marine (for example deep-sea habitats), coastal and terrestrial (for example woodland and forests)."
Land geomorphology,"Land geomorphology describes the structure of the land, such as mountains and valleys. Land geomorphology supports the provision of regulatory services, like erosion control."
Minerals,Minerals can be metallic or non-metallic. They support the provision of services like soil quality.
Ocean geomorphology,"Ocean geomorphology describes the structure of the marine environment such as shelfs and slopes. Ocean geomorphology supports the provision of regulatory services, like dilution by ecosystems."
Soils and sediments,"Soils and sediments comprise top-soil, sub-soil and ocean sediments. They support a number of regulatory services."
Species,"Species includes plants, animals, fungi, algae and genetic resources, which can be wild or domestic/commercial, for example livestock. Like habitats, species provide nearly all ecosystem services."
Water,"Water includes surface water, ground water, ocean water, fossil water and soil water. Water is important for a wide range of ecosystem services."
