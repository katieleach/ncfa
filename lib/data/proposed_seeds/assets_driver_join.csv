Species,Diseases,R,"Increased connectivity of global human populations has increased the frequency and magnitude of disease outbreaks. Disease vectors and pathogens can impact all species, and cause dramatic shifts in community structure, biodiversity ecosystem function and services, and human health. However, individual responses to diseases varies by species. Aspects of population biology are heavily researched, however the ecological and evolutionary impact of diseases, especially in marine environments, remain unknown. There is a paucity of baseline and epidemiological information on normal disease levels, which would aid understanding of pathogen transmission and host resistance.","Draught animals are rarely kept in herds, often kept apart from other animals, and are often in remote areas but may travel considerable distances and congregate in local markets. When an animal dies in the middle of a cultivation season it is difficult to borrow or hire another, because animal power is in demand. Ultimately reduced work output can be reflected in reduced farm productivity.","Service provision will decline in infected animals, e.g. cost of working oxen affected by bovine dermatophilosis in Zambia was USD 193 per affected ox.",Natural variation,Short term,Global
Species,Droughts,A,"Droughts have been observed to increase in frequency and intensity over the last 60 years and they are expected to increase over the next 100. Species are highly susceptible to droughts as most are dependent on water resources for survival. Negative impacts have been extensively documented in the literature with little variability in results across taxa, but with medium uncertainty. ",Change in service demand based on climate change impacts on water availability.,"The adaptability of the animals to climatic changes will determine the availability of the provision of the service. Animals which adapt faster to climate extremes, e.g. to aridity will maintain provision of the service. are most suited to particular areas. Already drought resistant animals (notably donkeys) are becoming increasingly appreciated in the drought affected areas of southern, eastern and western Africa. Over time though, animals adapt to grazing and consuming different types of grasses and plant species dependent upon on location, climate and availability.",Human action,Long term,Global
Habitats,Habitat modification,A,"Habitat modification directly impacts habitats: altering landscapes and communities through reducing population sizes and fragmenting ranges by imposing physical or biological barriers to dispersal. Habitats are susceptible to the changes brought by habitat modifaction, however habitats vary in resilience - therefore impacts differ. The direct impacts of disturbance on habitats (e.g. tropical forests) are still uncertain.","Habitat degradation and loss of plant species, thus reducing the number of plants available to perform phyto-remediation.",Decreased ability of plants to perform phyto-remediation.,Human action,"Short term - Habitat degradation can occur over the span of a few days, weeks, and/or months.",Local - This impact will be specific to areas that are most likely to be highly degraded as a result of human activities.
Habitats,Pollution,A,"Pollution can cause physical and chemical changes to habitats, which reduces provisioning capacity, subsequently impacting species. Habitats have the ability to recover from pollution impacts if not too overloaded with irreversible pollutants, with pollution type and loading level both important. Some habitats are more resilient to the effects of pollution - the relationship is usually context specific, and depends on the habitat, but also the type of contaminant. The direct impacts of pollution on habitats are still uncertain.",Habitat degradation and reduction or interruption of algal species’ ability to perform bio-remediation.,Decreased bio-remediation due to decreased ability of algae to perform bio-remediation.,Human action,Short term - An area can be saturated within hours or days resulting from a severe spill of contaminants. Mid-long term - Loss of environmental function occurs on a longer timescale.,"Local - This impact is specific to areas that are highly degraded or polluted. Conversely, algae that exist in highly regulated water bodies might be able to develop better and thus provide a better service."
Species,Habitat modification,R,"Species distributions, abundance and dynamics are expected to worsen in the long term.The distribution and abundance of a species are governed by the birth, growth, death and dispersal rates of individuals comprising a population. These rates are also affected by land use.  Habitat modification often leads to fragmentation - where there is a loss of habitat, reduced patch size and an increasing distance between patches - but can also lead to an increase of new habitat. Degradation of habitat quality or quantity can reduce population size and growth rates and elevate the change of local extinction events - as such they are highly susceptible to impacts. Each system varies by location, and individual species vary greatly in their response to habitat modification. There is a lot of published material on the effect of habitat modification on species, however there are still knowledge gaps.","Habitat degradation and loss of plant species, thus reducing the number of plants available to perform phyto-remediation.",Decreased ability of plants to perform phyto-remediation.,Human action,"Short term - Habitat degradation can occur over the span of a few days, weeks, and/or months.",Local - This impact will be specific to areas that are most likely to be highly degraded as a result of human activities.
Species,Invasive species,A,"Invasive species alter ecosystems - they outcompete indigenous species, which can have cascading effects across trophic levels, and in turn restructure communities and cause evolutionary changes. Invasive species can also facilitate native species through habitat modification (through acting as habitat engineers), pollination, competitive release and predatory release. These interactions can occur in a wide range of habitats, and different species have variability in their effect. The effects of invasive species are often difficult to detect or occur after long time lags - as such there is uncertainty in their impact. ",Increased populations of sea urchins lead to overgrazing of kelp,Decreased bio-remediation by kelp,Human action,"Mid-long term –
Trophic interactions change according to the rate of the reduction in predator populations, the subsequent effects can materialise within a few years",Global – Invasive species are widespread across the globe and are affecting species across a significant portion of their ranges
Species,Pollution,A,"Species distributions, abundance and dynamics are expected to worsen in the long term. Atmospheric deposition of reactive nitrogen has the potential to reduce plant species richness, through favouring species better adapted to high nutrient levels. Impacts of pollution on species varies by location and other external parameters, and there is medium uncertainty in this relationship.",Habitat degradation and reduction or interruption of algal species’ ability to perform bio-remediation.,Decreased bio-remediation due to decreased ability of algae to perform bio-remediation.,Human action,Short term - An area can be saturated within hours or days resulting from a severe spill of contaminants. Mid-long term - Loss of environmental function occurs on a longer timescale.,"Local - This impact is specific to areas that are highly degraded or polluted. Conversely, algae that exist in highly regulated water bodies might be able to develop better and thus provide a better service."
Species,Weather conditions,A,"Increased temperatures have led to alterations in species compositions, whilst extreme weather events have resulted in the increased morphology of biogenic habitats, altering resource use and inducing ecological niche displacement, negatively affecting species. This trend is expected to continue with expected increases in temperatures over the next 100 years. There is a high level of variability of response and susceptibility between taxonomic groups, and medium uncertainty, however, the disruptions caused by these processes are widely associated with negative impacts in the literature. ","Increased or decreased availability of solar energy for algae, which affects how well species are able to grow, survive, and perform their bio-remediation function.",Increased or decreased bio-remediation performed by algae. This variation occurs on seasonal or annual basis (e.g. solar radiance is lower in winter or when cloud cover is dense),Natural variation,Short term - Seasonal or annual variation in the amount of solar energy received on Earth and/or daily or seasonal variation in cloud cover.,Global - Weather conditions vary on a global scale. Regional - E.g. the tropics have very different weather patterns from temperate regions. Local - E.g. variation in the exact amount of solar energy received at the level of a specific pond.
Habitats,Droughts,R,"Droughts have become more intensive and frequent in the last 50 years and are projected to follow this trend over the next 100 years, increasing the negative pressures on habitats. Biogenic habitats are highly susceptible, as water imbalances induce the likelihood of disease, fire, wind erosion, insect infestation and losses in vegetative productivity. This data has been extensively modelled and assessed against historical records, consistently highlighting the negative response of habitats to drought. ",Damage protective vegetation.,Poor vegetation cover. Damage protective vegetation.,Human action,Short term,Local
Habitats,Flooding,R,"Flood events have increased in intensity and duration since the early 2000s and are expected to increase in the future with enhanced frequency directly impacting habitats. Freshwater habitats are highly susceptible to floods through geomorphological change and invasive species introduction. Consequently, it is expected that there will be a negative change in habitat due to increased frequency of floods. Due to the unpredictable nature of climate shocks and the variation in the intensity and duration of floods, habitat response is very variable and difficult to predict with certainty.",Loss of cover due to event induced tree throw. Wave action generated by winds.,Damage protective vegetation.,Natural,Short term,Universal
Habitats,Geological changes,R,"Habitats are increasingly subjected to changes as a result of geological changes induced by mass flows. Studies have shown increases in the frequency and intensity of the associated processes as a result of  anthropogenic expansion. Grassland and freshwater aquatic habitats are highly susceptible to the disruption in nutrient balances and water quality that mass flows cause. Extensive data on erosion processes highlight the negative impact on habitats, providing a level of certainty to the impact of geological changes to habitat, however, there is a level of variability in habitat responses.","Earth movements, alteration of slope steepness, the speed of runoff increases on steep slopes, which increases the power of water to break off and carry soil particles.",Increase soil break up and vulnerability to water erosion.,Natural,Short term,Local

No barriers for buffering and attenuation.,Human action,Short-mid term,Local
Habitats,Industrial or domestic activities,A,"As with the impacts from construction, habitat quantity and quality is anticipated to decline in the long term, as a result of pressures from economic development. Pollutants are a common byproduct of industrial and domestic activities. For example, these can cause sedimentation, altering habitats (e.g. riffles) and aquatic ecosystems (i.e. macrophytes and invertebrates). Traffic can also impact habitats as roads change soil density, temperature, soil water content, light levels, dust, surface waters, and introduction of heavy metals etc. Alternatively, road removal, relocation or remediation may provide ecological benefits, however these mechanisms are often complex, and there is some uncertainty. Some habitats are more resilient to impacts than others, therefore there is variabilty in responses. ",Strong wave action by boats,Coastal systems such as mangrove forests could be damaged.,Human action,Short term,Local
Habitats,Storms,R,"Storm intensity and frequency is expected to increase over the next 100 years  with tropical storms predicted to increase in intensity by 2-11%. Academic literature highlights that shallow coral reefs are susceptible to 60% losses in localised areas during hurricane force storms and that floral species compositions are likely to alter in favour of more robust species, altering habitat compositions. It is therefore expected that negative habitat changes will worsen gradually over the next 100 years. There is, however, a high level of variability in habitat responses to storms due to the high level of variety in storm conditions making certain quantification of the relationship difficult.",Loss of cover due to event induced tree throw. Wave action generated by winds.,Damage protective vegetation.,Natural,Short term,Universal
Habitats,Weather conditions,R,"Increased temperatures have led to alterations in vegetation composition, altering biotic components of habitats, whilst extreme weather events have resulted in the increased geomorphology of habitats globally. Alterations of existing habitats are therefore expected to increase over the next 100 years with predicted increases in temperatures and changes in climatic conditions. A wide variety of factors interact together to cause this effect. Consequently, a wide range of models and predictive methods are used to evaluate habitat responses, creating a large amount of variability and uncertainty in reported impacts.",Rainfall intensity,Risk as heavy raindrops on bare soil causes soil surface to seal increasing erodibility.

Land geomorphology,Flooding,R,"Floods impact land geomorphology by altering the natural flow of water bodies, moving large volumes of soil and sediments, deposit of sediments, washing away of rock fragments; they also indirectly cause change through erosion, habitat change and changes in soil. Susceptibility can be high and variability is high depending on slope, structure, habitat cover and the strength and duration of flooding. There is low uncertainty of the relationship.",Loss of cover due to event induced tree throw. Wave action generated by winds.,Damage protective vegetation.,Natural,Short term,Universal
Land geomorphology,Geological changes,A,"Erosion and landslides have significant impacts on hillslope morphology, river channels, valley floors, etc, and cause changes in structural elements such as elevation, relief, and slope. Susceptibility depends largely on length and angle of slope, soil and structural characteristics and strength of impact, thus there is variability in the response of the asset to this driver, but it is low. There is certainty that erosion and landslides affect land geomorphology.","Earth movements, alteration of slope steepness, the speed of runoff increases on steep slopes, which increases the power of water to break off and carry soil particles.",Increase soil break up and vulnerability to water erosion.,Natural,Short term,Local
Land geomorphology,Habitat modification,A,"Habitat changes such as deforestation, can indirectly alter land forms by exposing land to erosion and landslides, one of the main drivers of land form alterations. Susceptibility to impact is medium and variable, depending on the type of habitat change, soil and land structure features and strength of impact.

Land geomorphology,Industrial or domestic activities,A,"Human activities have become the third geomorphologic agent in the modern geomorphological process. Human intervention in natural geomorphological processes and structures is increasing in amount and strength through time. The impact and rate is correlated with increasing population growth and depends on the strength and intensity of the activity, as well as the intention. Intentional activities (eg. mining, construction, industry, waste generation, and construction of roads, canals, etc) and unintentional activities (e.g. erosion related to habitat modification) result in significant changes to the earth's subsurface. There is no uncertainty that human activities alter land forms.",Strong wave action by boats,Coastal systems such as mangrove forests could be damaged.,Human action,Short term,Local
Soils and sediments,Droughts,A,"Droughts can have a high impact on soil health, reducing fertility, causing changes in water balance, nutrient balance, biotic community, soil organic matter, and other biological and chemical properties. It also alters the physical characteristics of soil, like compaction, erodibility, and stability. Susceptibility is dependent on soil conditions, and length of droughts, which are both highly variable. There is a clear relationship between droughts and soils.",Damage protective vegetation.,Poor vegetation cover. Damage protective vegetation.,Human action,Short term,Local
Soils and sediments,Flooding,A,"Floods decrease the stability of soils, causing changes in inorganic and organic elements. Soil conditions, such as cultivated or non-cultivated soils, influence the degree of impact of floods, with cultivated soils likely to be more affected. Oxygen availability is also affected by extended flooding and causes a shift in nutrient cycling, and associated biota are greatly impacted, affecting soil processes in return. Susceptibility is high, with some variability depending on soil properties, and there is certainty in the relationship.",Loss of cover due to event induced tree throw. Wave action generated by winds.,Damage protective vegetation.,Natural,Short term,Universal
Soils and sediments,Geological changes,A,"Geological changes have direct negative effects on fertility, nutrient balance, water availability, soil biota, among others. Soil susceptibility to geological changes is dependent on various physical, biotic and chemical properties, and the erodibility of soil is highly dependent on external factors such as vegetation. However, soils subject to geological changes will be affected regardless, yet possibly in varying degrees. Some may take decades to recover. The relationship is linear and there is no uncertainty.","Earth movements, alteration of slope steepness, the speed of runoff increases on steep slopes, which increases the power of water to break off and carry soil particles.",Increase soil break up and vulnerability to water erosion.,Natural,Short term,Local
Soils and sediments,Habitat modification,A,"As an asset, soil and sediment trends are expected to worsen in the long term. Habitat modification can affect soils both chemically and physically. Physical modification, for example through agriculture, can increase exposure to the bare ground, reduced fertility or overgrazing - all which can affect soils. Each soil and sediment system has different environmental parameters, and will be affected differently by impacts of habitat modification. There is a degree of uncertainty in how far habitat modification impacts soils and sediments.","Diversion of drainage furrows, waterways, dam by washes, etc.",Run-off concentration.

Soils and sediments,Industrial or domestic activities,A,"Industrial activities and urbanisation are key sources of local soil contamination. Intensive activites such as inadequate waste disposal, and industry accidents can cause excessive contamination of soils. Urbanisation and industralisation also increases acid deposition in soils, changes in soil nutrients and soil water. Susceptibility of the soils and sediments to this driver is high, though there is some variability in how much they are affected, depending on the modern mechanisms and prevention measures in industry. There is no uncertainty that industrial and domestic activities impact soils and sediments.",Strong wave action by boats,Coastal systems such as mangrove forests could be damaged.,Human action,Short term,Local
Soils and sediments,Intensive agriculture and aquaculture,A,"Intensification in agricultural land-use and the use of inorganic fertlisers have had a great impact on soil degradation and quality. Modern agricultural practices such as machine tilling has a large impact on soil structure and reduces fertility. The damage depends largely on soil type and other factors. Agrochemicals cause soil pollution, changes in soil acidification, salinity, nutrient and water balance and soil biodiversity. There is a vast amount of literature on this driver and an increased focus on the impacts and roles of soils and sediments in this topic, thus there is no uncertainty of the impact of intensive agriculture and aquaculture on soils and sediments.",Changes soil properties,Changes soil water retention properties thus increases susceptibility to water or wind erosion.,Human action,Short-mid term,Local
Soils and sediments,Storms,A,"Storms drive soil erosion by changes in rainfall and wind intensity, runoff and loss of structural stability. Runoff can cause loss of nutrients and fertility. Susceptibility depends on soil properties and driver intensity, variability of the response is thus high. Uncertainty of the relationship is low. ",Loss of cover due to event induced tree throw. Wave action generated by winds.,Damage protective vegetation.,Natural,Short term,Universal
Soils and sediments,Weather conditions,A,"Soils and sediments can be dried out and rearranged during windy weather. As soil is dried out, plant growth is reduced, which reduces the stability of the surface layer and leads to erosion. Desertification is a more extreme version of this process, where soils that lose stable plant communities become unstable themselves, and subsequently start to shift around. In contrast, increases in precipitation can cause changes to soil texture and structure, with increases in run-off causing reduction in top soil (which is often the most productive part of a soil horizon). The impact will depend on the intensity and duration of weather conditions, as well as the location. There is some uncertainty in the relationship.",Rainfall intensity,Risk as heavy raindrops on bare soil causes soil surface to seal increasing erodibility.

Atmosphere,Habitat modification,R,"Habitat modification can result in extensive carbon release (e.g. deforestation via slash and burn) that contributes >10% of carbon emissions globally, increasing air and surface temperatures and altering circulation currents in the atmosphere. With increases in habitat modification projected, the composition of atmospheric gases and climate variability are expected to continue over the next 100 years. The atmosphere is therefore susceptible to the impacts of habitat modification. However, projections of habitat modification related to atmospheric changes can be highly variable due to unexpected events and climate shock induced spikes in CO2 releases creating uncertainty in projections (e.g. drought associated forest fires in indonesia 2016).",Conversion of wetlands for commercial purposes and resource extraction leads to loss of regional climate regulating function.,Conversion of wetlands causes the average temperature to increase by 0.77?C in all four seasons.,Human action,Mid-term,Global - wetlands
Atmosphere,Industrial or domestic construction,A,"Population pressure is predicted to continue over the next 50 years, driving greater industrialisation, especially within developing countries. Models predict an overall trend of increased compositional change in the atmosphere over the next 100 years in response. Atmosphere is increasingly susceptible to these changes as current deforestation rates reduce natural filtration processes. It is estimated that extreme climate processes, such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation, will increase as a result of associated global warming changing convection currents in both the oceans and the atmosphere. Evolving international and domestic regulations and policies in favour of environmentally friendly technology means that the relationship between the atmosphere and industry cannot be predicted with a high degree of certainty over an extended period of time and that there is a high degree of variability between prediction models.

Atmosphere,Weather conditions,R,"Global atmospheric temperatures in 2016 rose to >0.94C of the 20th-century average and are predicted to increase (>2C in 100 years), this is correlated with extreme weather events, with 18% of extreme precipitation and 75% of daily heat extremes being ascribed to global warming via a robust model with low uncertainty.  The effects are not uniform across the globe due to an interplay between surface ocean heat distribution and atmospheric heat re-distribution, resulting in high variability in the response of weather patterns to atmospheric and surface temperature changes. With increasing negative drivers and reduced regulatory capacity across the globe, the atmosphere is highly susceptible to exhibit further negative weather patterns in the future.",Climatic anomalies (e.g. ENSO) create deficits and excesses in temperature and precipitation.,"Regulation of regional climate is heavily impacted, e.g. an El Niño is associated with warm and very wet weather months in April–October causing major flooding in southern hemisphere countries such as Peru and Ecuador.",Natural variation,Long-term,Regional - tropics and sub-tropics

Soils and sediments,Weather conditions,A,"Soils and sediments can be dried out and rearranged during windy weather. As soil is dried out, plant growth is reduced, which reduces the stability of the surface layer and leads to erosion. Desertification is a more extreme version of this process, where soils that lose stable plant communities become unstable themselves, and subsequently start to shift around. In contrast, increases in precipitation can cause changes to soil texture and structure, with increases in run-off causing reduction in top soil (which is often the most productive part of a soil horizon). The impact will depend on the intensity and duration of weather conditions, as well as the location.

Greenhouse gases remain the largest and most important driver of global warming and atmospheric change, consequently the atmosphere has a high susceptibility to emission based drivers of change. Despite these figures, there is a lack of consistent and comprehensive assessments of the emission effects on the atmosphere by the transport sector in isolation, resulting in large variability in predictions relating to the impact of human movements on the atmosphere.

Models predict an overall trend of increased compositional change in the atmosphere over the next 100 years in response. Atmosphere is increasingly susceptible to these changes as current deforestation rates reduce natural filtration processes. It is estimated that extreme climate processes, such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation, will increase as a result of associated global warming changing convection currents in both the oceans and the atmosphere. Evolving international and domestic regulations and policies in favour of environmentally friendly technology means that the relationship between the atmosphere and industry cannot be predicted with a high degree of certainty over an extended period of time and that there is a high degree of variability between prediction models.

Habitats,Fire,R,"In the short term, fires rapidly reduce habitat availability (and in turn reduce available food, shelter, refuges) - patches that do remain are often isolated and undesirable. More intense fires change multiple aspects of vegetation structure - foliage and vegetation is stripped and killed, and soil will be exposed leading to higher rates of erosion. However, fire is a widely used management regime, and restoration of vegetation post-fire can often lead to increases in habitat availability and quality, e.g. through reducing litter and dead vegetation. Fire plays a role in maintaining natural heterogeneity in the environment, and this disturbance-mediated heterogeneity leads to a mosaic of habitats or successional stages that support species. Fire does not only simplify vegetative structure and remove plant species; it also creates new habitat features. It is difficult to obtain a full history of fire events, as many fires go unrecorded. In addition some indicators (such as fire scars) can be unreliable - for example, trees are commonly charred but not scarred, and shallow scars may also be burned away by subsequent fires. Therefore there is uncertainty in the relationship.",There will be a reduction in plant based fibre material post fire and during recovery period.,Imbalances in the fire cycle caused by extreme weather such as drought can create severe fires which affect provision of fibre and other plant based materials.,Natural variation,Long-term,"Global - grasslands, shrub lands and forests"

Degradation of habitat quality or quantity can reduce population size and growth rates and elevate the change of local extinction events - as such they are highly susceptible to impacts.

Habitats,Fire,R,"In the short term, fires rapidly reduce habitat availability (and in turn reduce available food, shelter, refuges) - patches that do remain are often isolated and undesirable. More intense fires change multiple aspects of vegetation structure - foliage and vegetation is stripped and killed, and soil will be exposed leading to higher rates of erosion. However, fire is a widely used management regime, and restoration of vegetation post-fire can often lead to increases in habitat availability and quality, e.g. through reducing litter and dead vegetation. Fire plays a role in maintaining natural heterogeneity in the environment, and this disturbance-mediated heterogeneity leads to a mosaic of habitats or successional stages that support species. Fire does not only simplify vegetative structure and remove plant species; it also creates new habitat features. It is difficult to obtain a full history of fire events, as many fires go unrecorded. In addition some indicators (such as fire scars) can be unreliable - for example, trees are commonly charred but not scarred, and shallow scars may also be burned away by subsequent fires.

It has been shown that the degree of exoskeleton response is variable based on available nutritional factors in seawater but that decreases in pH cause a general negative impact on growth.

Species,Diseases,R,"Increased connectivity of global human populations has increased the frequency and magnitude of disease outbreaks. Disease vectors and pathogens can impact all species, and cause dramatic shifts in community structure, biodiversity ecosystem function and services, and human health. However, individual responses to diseases varies by species. Aspects of population biology are heavily researched, however the ecological and evolutionary impact of diseases, especially in marine environments, remain unknown.

Species,Habitat modification,R,"Species distributions, abundance and dynamics are expected to worsen in the long term.The distribution and abundance of a species are governed by the birth, growth, death and dispersal rates of individuals comprising a population. These rates are also affected by land use.  Habitat modification often leads to fragmentation - where there is a loss of habitat, reduced patch size and an increasing distance between patches - but can also lead to an increase of new habitat. Degradation of habitat quality or quantity can reduce population size and growth rates and elevate the change of local extinction events - as such they are highly susceptible to impacts.

Despite extensive legislative safeguards, release of genetically modified genomes in to wild populations is predicted to increase and cause alterations in species compositions. Despite extensive studies on the topic there is uncertainty in the impact on natural species, however, it is more widely believed that the technology will cause negative impacts on species population stability. This is particularly prevalent in agricultural plant and fish species where horizontal gene transfer to wild populations is most likely to have the largest negative impacts.

Species,Overfishing,A,"As with overhunting, overfishing has significant direct and indirect effects on the diversity, structure and productivity of benthic communities. The impact varies by location. Some species may be more resilient to overfishing than others, and this depends on the size of the species, intensity of fishing, life history strategy, habitat size and location.

Insect pests can attack plants - delaying seed ripening, reducing seed production and individual seed weights, reducing the rates of shoot and root growth, increasing the susceptibility of plants to disease and reducing the competitive ability of plants relative to their unattacked neighbours. Vertebrate pests can also cause huge economic losses to agriculture, and need to be appropriately managed. Species are impacted differently by pests - some have greater resilience than others, due to their life parameters (e.g. survival rates etc.).

Species,Storms,A,"Storm frequency and intensity is predicted to continue in alignment with current anthropogenically induced climate change. It is well documented that strong winds and increased rainfall can subject species to biogenic habitat changes, nest destruction, invasive species introduction and saltwater intrusion, negatively impacting species survival in localised event contexts. Species that are highly susceptible are those that cannot shelter from wind effectively, that are liable to flooding, subject to habitat displacement (e.g. sand dune burrows), and migrating species. Historical records provide a degree of certainty that an increase in storm intensity and frequency will have an negative impact on many species overall, however, some species may benefit in the short term from storm activity, for example scavengers such as raccoons have been shown to benefit from storms.

Water,Flooding,R,"Floods cause damage to water supply systems, leading to insufficient drinking-water supplies and contamination of drinking water. Changes to global climate will see increased flood events. In the UK about 70% of drinking water is collected from upland catchments, and they are the source of flood water for many locations. Upland areas have steep slopes and increased run-off, and floods arise when capacity of the rivers downstream to absorb the upland run-off is exceeded. Changes in vegetation cover, can aid flood risk, as can reducing soil compaction in upland areas, in addition to maintaining sustainable drainage systems, and other urban infrastructure.

Water,Intensive agriculture and aquaculture,R,"A high proportion of pollution originates from agricultural sources, due to reduction in industrial effluent and an increase in agricultural intensification. Agricultural intensification releases nutrients (through soil management and fertilisers) and other chemicals (e.g. pesticides) into water courses, through biological contamination (e.g. from bacteria in manure) and through soil runoff. Aquaculture can have an impact on waterbodies, through waste products, food surpluses and drug residuals. The majority of aquaculture practices have had few adverse effects on ecosystems. However, there are a few examples of environmental degradation due to intensive cage culture operations and some shrimp farming practices. This trend for intensive agriculture and aquaculture is anticipated to worsen in the long term, due to food pressures related to an increasing population, with water sources being fairly susceptible to impacts.

With increases in habitat modification projected, the composition of atmospheric gases and climate variability are expected to continue over the next 100 years. The atmosphere is therefore susceptible to the impacts of habitat modification.

Extensive studies have shown that GHG exudation significantly increases radiative forcing, trapping heat within the atmosphere, contributing to global warming and altering convection currents and atmospheric pressures. Although GHG effects are predicted with high levels of certainty there is far greater uncertainty regarding the levels of aerosols and their impact on radiative forcing and the atmosphere, resulting in some variability in the effects of pollution on the atmosphere over time.

Unless water is returned in equal volumes to water bodies after abstraction, then the volume of surface water provided through water bodies will be reduced by the amount that is not returned.",Human action,Short term - Water abstraction for human purposes occurs on a daily basis and in many areas is resulting in over use.,"Local - Restricted to areas of high and unsustainable water use, such as big cities, and large industrial and agricultural areas."
Water,Weather conditions,R,"Weather conditions can affect water in a number of different ways. In the short term, daily to seasonal variation in rainfall affects how solar energy impacts water in landscapes; in the mid term there are inter-annual variations in rainfall; and in the long term, decadal variation in rainfall patterns. These will cause water quality changes (physico-chemical parameters, introduction of micropollutants and biological parameters), which will impact drinking water production and human health. Water has a medium susceptibility to the impacts of weather conditions, and each water system is different - so weather conditions have varying impacts. There is medium uncertainty in how climate change and other pressures related to weather conditions will impact water systems in the future.",This affects watershed- or catchment-level water flows (i.e. increase or decrease in volume of water flowing through water bodies).,Increase or decrease in surface water provision.,Natural variation,Short term - This variation is seasonal or annual.,Global - Such variation occurs on a global scale.
Species,Habitat modification,R,"Species distributions, abundance and dynamics are expected to worsen in the long term.The distribution and abundance of a species are governed by the birth, growth, death and dispersal rates of individuals comprising a population. These rates are also affected by land use.  Habitat modification often leads to fragmentation - where there is a loss of habitat, reduced patch size and an increasing distance between patches - but can also lead to an increase of new habitat. Degradation of habitat quality or quantity can reduce population size and growth rates and elevate the change of local extinction events - as such they are highly susceptible to impacts. Each system varies by location, and individual species vary greatly in their response to habitat modification. There is a lot of published material on the effect of habitat modification on species, however there are still knowledge gaps.",Terrestrial vegetation lost and transpiration decreases.,Cooling and ventilation effect is lost and regional climate permanently altered.,Human action,Long term,Local
Species,Population changes,A,"Population changes affect species dynamics and ecological communities. There are many models of population dynamics, which take into account parameters such as colonisation and extinction rates, available habitats, food supply etc. These parameters vary between species, and susceptibility of species to change can also vary - for example, some species have different life parameters which make them more resilient to changes in population dynamics. These relationships are usually described through models, to which there is a degree of uncertainty.",Extinction risk factors including habitat loss and microbial invasions lead to reduction in microbial populations and diversity.,Diminishes the ability of the microorganisms to consume VOCs and ventilate indoor air.,Human action,Short-long term,Global

Atmosphere,Habitat modification,R,"Habitat modification can result in extensive carbon release (e.g. deforestation via slash and burn) that contributes >10% of carbon emissions globally, increasing air and surface temperatures and altering circulation currents in the atmosphere. With increases in habitat modification projected, the composition of atmospheric gases and climate variability are expected to continue over the next 100 years. The atmosphere is therefore susceptible to the impacts of habitat modification. However, projections of habitat modification related to atmospheric changes can be highly variable due to unexpected events and climate shock induced spikes in CO2 releases creating uncertainty in projections (e.g. drought associated forest fires in indonesia 2016).

Atmosphere,Pollution,R,"Atmospheric measurements have shown steady increases in the amounts of greenhouse gases (GHG), aerosols and particulates over the last 20 years as a result of anthropogenic pollution and are expected to continue, altering atmospheric compositions over the next 100 years. Decreases in vegetation filtering services provided by photosynthesis and dry deposition, as a result of deforestation, has left the atmosphere highly susceptible to further increases. Extensive studies have shown that GHG exudation significantly increases radiative forcing, trapping heat within the atmosphere, contributing to global warming and altering convection currents and atmospheric pressures. Although GHG effects are predicted with high levels of certainty there is far greater uncertainty regarding the levels of aerosols and their impact on radiative forcing and the atmosphere, resulting in some variability in the effects of pollution on the atmosphere over time.

The effects are not uniform across the globe due to an interplay between surface ocean heat distribution and atmospheric heat re-distribution, resulting in high variability in the response of weather patterns to atmospheric and surface temperature changes. With increasing negative drivers and reduced regulatory capacity across the globe, the atmosphere is highly susceptible to exhibit further negative weather patterns in the future.",Increases or decreases in the amount of rainfall and solar energy available on a regional/local basis.,Increased or decreased water balances within landscapes.,Natural variation,Short term - Daily to seasonal variation in rainfall and cloud cover that affects how solar energy impacts water in landscapes.

Habitats,Pollution,A,"Pollution can cause physical and chemical changes to habitats, which reduces provisioning capacity, subsequently impacting species. Habitats have the ability to recover from pollution impacts if not too overloaded with irreversible pollutants, with pollution type and loading level both important.

Water,Habitat modification,R,"Habitat modification changes the use and distribution of water - the systems are fairly susceptible to change. Agriculture results in irrigation and pesticide use - causing changes to the level of groundwater and surface water provision, and water quality. Urbanisation causes changes to drainage - resulting in flooding. Stream ecosystems are impacted negatively by dams and weirs, as well as a lack of in-stream structural diversity, channelisation and an increased introduction of fine sediments from the catchments due to changes in land use. Increasing pressures from economic development will see further changes to habitats within the long term.

Species,Ocean acidification,R,"Measurements and models indicate that global oceanic pH levels are predicted to become 170% more acidic by 2100. It has been shown that increased CO2 levels exceed the oceanic buffering capacity of carbonate ions, resulting in carbonate desaturation. Corals, echinoderms, plankton and pteropod species are unable to grow through exoskeletal extension in unsaturated carbonate conditions, with variable rates of reduction, and invitro studies show dissolution of existing exoskeletons under saturation scenarios based on acidification concentrations predicted for 2050. This greatly reduces primary food sources in the marine realm causing devastating impacts on marine and marine-dependent species.

Stormwater enters reservoirs, causing turbid and anoxic conditions - reducing water quality. It is predicted that the frequency of extreme rainfall events will occur more frequently in the future. Water systems vary by location, as such impacts vary. The relationship between storm events and water supply is less well developed.",Increases in nutrients and changes in chemical composition of freshwater bodies. Physical alterations of turbidity and water flow.,Increased nutrients and/or chemicals can upset chemical condition of freshwater.,Human action,Short term - Storms occur over a number of hours or days.,Regional - This impact will occur in areas of the world that are prone to storms.
Water,Weather conditions,R,"Weather conditions can affect water in a number of different ways. In the short term, daily to seasonal variation in rainfall affects how solar energy impacts water in landscapes; in the mid term there are inter-annual variations in rainfall; and in the long term, decadal variation in rainfall patterns. These will cause water quality changes (physico-chemical parameters, introduction of micropollutants and biological parameters), which will impact drinking water production and human health. Water has a medium susceptibility to the impacts of weather conditions, and each water system is different - so weather conditions have varying impacts. There is medium uncertainty in how climate change and other pressures related to weather conditions will impact water systems in the future.",Changes in salinity and temperature.,Variations in chemical condition of salt water. The magnitude of the effect of this variation is minor as systems are adapted to tolerate them.,Natural variation,Short term - Seasonal or annual variation.,"Global, Regional - The hydrological cycle occurs on a global scale and affects all water bodies."
