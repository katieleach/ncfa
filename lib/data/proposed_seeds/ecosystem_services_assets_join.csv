Animal-based energy,Species,R,"There is a linear relationship between animal-based energy and species because a decrease in the number of animals would result in a decrease in the amount of energy provided by animals. As such, animal-based energy is highly sensitive to changes in animal abundance, however these changes can be reversed if the condition animals are living in are improved, such as disease reduction. Animal-based energy cannot be replaced by anything as only animals can provide this service. There is low uncertainty in the relationship between animal-based energy and species because they are intrinsically linked. "

Soil quality,Land geomorphology,R,"Topography (variation as slope angle) determines energy of weathering processes from water and it affects drainage. Sensitivity to variation of the asset can be generally quite high but depends on the material and the nature of the weathering profile. Reversibility of a change to the asset is unlikely given the nature of topographical changes. The substitutability is dependant on the parent material and the weathering processes specific to that site as there can be are multiple weathering agents. The nature of any particular weathering profile will reflect the interactions between climate, topography, parent material, soil biota and time and factors related to the nature of the mineral itself. There is relatively little known about this relationship."
Soil quality,Minerals,R,"Weathering processes act on rocks (minerals), they are therefore directly linked, unsubstitutable, and the service is complete dependent on this asset as a whole. The nature of any particular weathering profile will reflect the interactions between climate, topography, parent material, soil biota and time and factors related to the nature of the mineral itself.  If the natural conditions of the asset are restored, the impact of changes on the service may be reversed. There is relatively little known about this relationship."
Soil quality,Minerals,A,"The relationship between minerals and decomposition and fixing processes is linear as these directly provide this service by fixation of some compounds, as well as providing the conditions for biological fixation by other assets. The service is sensitive to changes in mineral availability, and this can cause alteration of the decomposition and fixation capacity of other assets. If the natural conditions of the asset are restored, the impact of changes on the service may be reversed. Minerals are not substitutable for any other asset of this service, as the assets are part of a system and do not work independently. There is low uncertainty in the direct relationship between minerals and the service of decomposition and fixation processes."

Soil quality,Soils and sediments,A,"Soils provide compounds derived from decomposing organic matter or from soil microbes, or ions that drive chemical weathering in the soil or surface water. Soils host biotic agents that drive weathering. Weathering processes do not operate in isolation, it is a complex coupling of physico-chemical and biological processes. Sensitivity of weathering to changes in soil will depend on properties changed, and type of parent material. For processes dependent on soil, these will most like be also driven by biological and other agents of chemical weathering therefore the service has medium sensitivity to loss of soils as an asset. Soils are a supporting asset. Given the temporal nature of weathering processes, reversibility is possible through active restoration. There is medium uncertainty in the relationship."

Changes to species may be reversed if pollution is reduced and with active restoration of species populations. Species are a supporting asset for chemical condition of freshwaters as a service. There is low uncertainty in the relationship between chemical condition of freshwaters and species because they are intrinsically linked.
Water quality,Species,A,"There is a non-linear relationship between chemical condition of salt waters and species as they are not directly linked. Chemical condition of salt waters is sensitive to changes in species, for example an increase in phytoplankton due to eutrophication can lead to a depletion of dissolved oxygen in the water. Changes may be reversed if nutrient input is reduced or species populations are restored. Species are a supporting asset for chemical condition of salt waters as a service. There is low uncertainty in the relationship between chemical condition of salt waters and species because they are intrinsically linked."
