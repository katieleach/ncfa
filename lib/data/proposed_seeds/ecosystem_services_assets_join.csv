Soil quality,Minerals,R,"Minerals are important for soil fertility since the surfaces act as sites for nutrient storage. As soil particles begin to weather, primary minerals release nutrients into the soil. As these particles decrease in size, the soil is also able to retain greater amounts of nutrients. Minerals are therefore directly linked, unsubstitutable, and soil quality is completely dependent on them. If the natural conditions of the asset are restored, the impact of changes on the service may be reversed. There is however relatively little known about this relationship."
