Driver of change,Description
Diseases,"Harmful pathogens and microbes that are originally found within the ecosystem(s) in question, but have become “out-of-balance” or “released” directly or indirectly due to human activities."
Droughts,Periods in which rainfall falls below the normal range of variation.
Earthquakes,"Earthquakes and associated events, such as tsunamis."
Fire,Suppression or increase in fire frequency and/or intensity outside of its natural range of variation.
Flooding,Extreme precipitation events.
Geological changes,"Avalanches, landslides or precipitation events that lead to geological changes."
Habitat modification,Major changes in habitat composition and location.
Human modification of genetic material,Human altered or transported organisms or genes.
Human movement,"Migration by people from one place to another with the intentions of settling, permanently or temporarily in a new location."
Industrial or domestic activities,"Human settlements or other non-agricultural land uses with a substantial footprint, production of non-biological resources and/or non-consumptive uses of biological resources."
Industrial or domestic construction,Process of constructing a building or infrastructure for industrial or domestic purposes.
Intensive agriculture and aquaculture,"Threats from farming and ranching as a result of agricultural expansion and intensification, including silviculture, mariculture and aquaculture (includes the impacts of any fencing around farmed areas)."
Invasive species,"Harmful plants, animals, pathogens and other microbes not originally found within the ecosystem(s) in question and directly or indirectly introduced and spread into it by human activities."
Ocean acidification,Changes to the ocean chemistry which occurs when carbon dioxide is absorbed and reacts with seawater to produce acid.
Ocean current and circulation,Large scale movement of waters in the ocean basins.
Overfishing,"Harvesting aquatic wild animals or plants for commercial, recreation, subsistence, research, or cultural purposes, or for control/persecution reasons; includes accidental mortality/bycatch."
Overharvesting,"Harvesting plants, fungi, trees and other woody vegetation, and other non-timber/non-animal products, for commercial, recreation, subsistence, research or cultural purposes, or for control reasons."
Overhunting,"Killing or trapping terrestrial wild animals or animal products for commercial, recreation, subsistence, research or cultural purposes, or for control/persecution reasons; includes accidental mortality/bycatch."
Pests,"Harmful plants or animals that are originally found within the ecosystem(s) in question, but have become “out-of-balance” or “released” directly or indirectly due to human activities."
Pollution,Threats from introduction of exotic and/or excess materials or energy from point and non-point sources.
Population changes,Changes in species populations over time and space.
Sea level rise,Increase in global mean sea level as a result of an increase in the volume of water in the world's oceans.
Sea surface temperature,Periods in which sea surface temperatures exceed or go below the normal range of variation.
Storms,Extreme precipitation and/or wind events.
Volcanoes,Volcanic events which may lead to changes in natural capital assets.
Water abstraction,Changing water flow patterns from their natural range of variation due to human activities.
Weather conditions,Weather conditions outside of the natural range of variation.
