Ecosystem Service,Category,Description
Animal-based energy,Direct Physical Input,"Some animals are used in tasks such as ploughing or logging due to their sheer physical strength. Such animals are grouped as a draught or draft animals, for example horses, oxen, elephant and camels. Others may be used as pack animals, for animal-powered transport, the movement of people and goods. People ride some animals directly as mounts; alternatively, one or more animals in harness may be used to pull vehicles. Physical labour is provided by domesticated or commercial species, including oxen, horses, donkeys, goats and elephants. These can be grouped as draught animals, pack animals and mounts. The minimum conditions for maintaining animal-based energy are healthy, well-nourished animal species devoid of disease."
Bio-remediation,Mitigates Direct Impacts,"Bio-remediation is a natural process whereby living organisms such as micro-organisms, plants, algae, and some animals (e.g. invertebrates and fish in aquatic habitats and invertebrates in soils) degrade, reduce, and/or detoxify contaminants. That is, waste products (e.g. waste water) and pollutants (e.g. chemicals, oil). Bio-remediation by micro-organisms can occur by bio-stimulation, bio-augmentation, bio-accumulation, and bio-sorption. Bio-remediation by algae is a natural process whereby algal cells, both dead and living, degrade, reduce, capture, and/or detoxify waste products (e.g. waste water) and pollutants (e.g. heavy metals, chemicals, oil). Bio-remediation by plants, also referred to as phytoremediation, is defined as the use of plants to decontaminate air, soils and water. A number of approaches to phytoremediation exist, including phytoextraction, phytofiltration, phytostabilisation, phytovolatilisation, phytodegradation, phytodesalination, and rhizodegradation, or rhizoremediation. Animals can benefit bioremediation by supporting micro-organisms by increasing the overall metabolic activity of the soil and by serving indicators of toxicity levels and contaminants remaining in the soil. The most common groups of species that are used for these purposes are invertebrates (e.g. earthworms, mites). The underlying asset components are natural chemical interactions; environmental conditions that enable bioremediation; solar energy; and natural marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats such as forests, grasslands, wetlands, marshlands and shorelands that support the micro- and macro-organisms that provide bio-remediation services. The minimum conditions for the maintenance of the service flow are the survival of the organisms providing the service; and the maintenance of the environmental conditions that allow these species to survive and perform their natural bio-remediating functions."
Buffering and attenuation of mass flows,Protection from Disruption,"Buffering and attenuation of mass flows is delivered through vegetated habitats, and soils and sediments. Underlying asset components include, Vegetated buffer strips along lakes and streams protect and improve water quality by filtering sediments, stabilizing stream banks and shorelines and preventing erosion. Vegetation, ideally forests, in upper catchments helps stop mass flow and erosion. Trees and woody decries on floodplains increases hydraulic roughness, slowing down flood flows and enhancing flood storage. Vegetation (forests) can affect the likelihood of an avalanche release and can protect human settlements and infrastructure . Plant root systems along bodies of water provide slope stability and soil erosion control. Plants shelter and fix soil with their roots, protecting soil against erosion by reducing water runoff. In coastal systems, mangrove forests protect coastlines from erosion; these dense forests reduce the impact of waves and prevent erosion by increasing friction and reducing storm surge peak water levels. Tidal and wave energy are dissipated to lower levels, protecting the shoreline and allowing salt marshes and reeds to grow which in turn reduces erosion. Run-off systems manage runoff concentrations to prevent saturation of soil resulting in erosion or landslides. Top soil cover provided by plants and other organisms. Several species of soil algae form a layer over land, as a form of surface cover, which reduces soil losses in comparison with the losses from bare lands. Soil properties such as salinity, texture, aggregations, strength, content, and infiltration capacities determine effects of root systems properties, resistance to raindrop impact, and resistance to soil break up and gully formation, among others. The minimum conditions for maintaining the service flow are strong vegetated buffering strips along water ways, and well-structured soils and sediments."
Climate regulation,Protection from Disruption,"The main greenhouse gases causing climate change are carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). It is important to distinguish between carbon sequestration by terrestrial ecosystems from carbon capture and storage by industrial processes, the latter a manmade strategy for achieving CO2 reduction targets. The natural system providing this service is sequestration of atmospheric CO2 by photosynthesis and its long term storage in soils, vegetable biomass, and the oceans. The global soil carbon pool includes about 1,550 Gt of soil organic carbon (SOC) and 950 Gt of soil inorganic carbon. Soil carbon sequestration has the potential to offset fossil-fuel emissions by 0.4 to 1.2 Gt of carbon per year. SOC is responsible for maintaining the overall quality of the soil asset by retaining soil nutrients, decreasing erosion risk, improving soil structure and acting as an energy source for soil micro-organisms. Therefore soil degradation through land use change will reduce the quality of the asset. The minimum conditions for maintaining the service flow are air temperature, precipitation and soil nitrogen availability in the upper 10 cm of the mineral soil. Approximately one third of global anthropogenic CO2 emissions are sequestered by the oceans. The main processes involved in water-based carbon sequestration are carbon storage in sediments, carbon sequestration in the water column, and air-sea CO2 exchange. Micro-algae absorb considerable amounts of greenhouse gas emissions through photosynthesis. Dead phytoplankton carry this carbon to the seabed, where it is trapped in seabed sediment along with methane gas released when the planktonic organisms are decomposing. These deposited gases are locked in the sediment at extremely high pressures and create a vast carbon store which can remain undisturbed for geological timescales. Carbon captured by other marine biota, such as in marine vegetated habitats like mangroves, is known as blue carbon. Dissolved organic carbon in the water column comprises the vast majority of the organic matter in the oceanic water column originating from freshwater runoff, microscopic plants that live in the bottom of the ocean, and phytoplankton. The provision of organic material to ocean sediments is the major driver of the quality of the organic carbon content of the oceans. Marine dissolved organic material is produced in-situ by dead photosynthetic plankton and other oceanic plants and animals. Terrestrial organic carbon is supplied to ocean sediment by rivers, winds, and in high latitudes by icebergs or sea ice. Ocean circulation is the primary driver of oceanic CO2 uptake via air-sea carbon exchange. Terrestrial sediment, transported to the sea by freshwater flows, drives the occurrence of marine vegetated habitats in coastal settings. For burial of sources of organic carbon, a minimum condition is the build-up of sediments on the ocean shelf slopes which cascade down the shelf as turbidites. The transfer efficiency of organic carbon increases with the flux of carbonate and decreases with water depth and seasonality. The sequestration rate of the ocean is strongly determined by the downward movement of surface water to the depths. Micro and regional climate is regulated by chemical-physical processes taking place in surface freshwater resources, oceans and the atmosphere. The main processes are thermohaline ocean circulation, a large scale, global movement of ocean water caused by density differences linked to temperature and salinity of the sea water column, global wind patterns and the cooling effect of water bodies. Habitats also regulate micro and regional climate though biophysical processes. The main components of the services are the stabilizing effect of (wetland) vegetation on air temperature in urban climates, shading and evapotranspiration decreasing solar radiation absorption in urban areas, absorption of pollutants by urban vegetation and regulation of microclimate through evapotranspiration by forests. The minimum condition to maintain the service flow are: distance from the sea, ocean currents, direction of prevailing winds, distance from the equator and the El Niño phenomenon."
Dilution by atmosphere and ecosystems,Mitigates Direct Impacts,"The main assets of this system are saline water, fresh water, and atmospheric dilution. Saline water constitutes 96.5% of the total water on Earth. The minimum conditions for maintaining this service flow are the ambient density stratification of the seawater and local currents. Stratification occurs when water masses of different characteristics, e.g. salinity, oxygenation or temperature differences, form layers which don’t mix well. The least favourable stratification conditions are those which create the lowest potential for dilution. Therefore maximum seawater vertical density stratification results in minimum dilution. Sea water density in turn is determined by salinity. Salinity variations are driven by precipitation, evaporation, runoff and ice freezing and melting. Underlying asset components include the stratification of sea water which is driven by density, salinity and temperature and surface wind direction and strength. In the deep ocean, a minimum condition for the dilution of at-sea pollutants, such as radioactive waste, is the horizontal and vertical velocities of the currents. The total freshwater volume of the Earth is 2.5% of the planet’s total water content. The freshwater system consists of lakes, rivers and streams, including wetlands such as swamps and bogs. The hydrological cycle maintains the quality of the service as the flows of the cycle provide the means to disperse and dilute fluids and solid waste. The capacity of freshwater systems to dilute can be summarised by the dilution factor, i.e. the ratio of freshwater by volume to human effluent, thus, low dilution factors may result from low runoff, high population density, or a combination of both. The system components are lakes, streams, rivers, and wetlands. The quality of the asset in these components is determined by nutrient content, algal concentration, and transparency of the water. In order to keep the dilution factor to an optimum, a ratio of river flow to raw wastewater flow of 40 to 1 is recommended. Atmospheric dilution is defined as wind movement to spread atmospheric impurities over larger areas and to mix them with the air in the atmosphere. The main sources of natural atmospheric impurities are volcanic emissions, forest fires, biological decay and gases emitted from trapped air bubbles in ice, ocean water etc. Other natural sources are radioactive gases resulting from cosmic ray interaction with the atmosphere and the decay of radioactive substances on earth. Industrial processes have far exceeded natural emissions so that they can no longer be absorbed and broken down by natural atmospheric processes at the same rate as they are being emitted. Instead they are only being dispersed and diluted throughout the atmosphere. Atmospheric conditions, such as cloud cover, wind speed, vertical temperature profile, turbulence levels and surface radiation are the main system components influencing the quality of the asset. The emission height influences the availability of the asset, i.e. whether the pollutants are emitted at the ground level or from taller objects such as chimneys. Local and regional topography also plays a role, such as the presence of hills and valleys. The nature of the pollutant source, whether it is diffuse or a point, may determine the asset quality. The minimum conditions maintaining the dilution service is the action of transport and dispersion, i.e. horizontal wind movement across the surface of the Earth and vertical movement up to the maximum limit of the atmosphere. Wind direction and speed is also important."
Disease control,Protection from Disruption,"Human disease control is provided through regulation of the disease transmission cycles and controlling spill over into human populations. The control mechanisms are density-dependent processes such as acquired immunity to infectious disease and limits on the carrying capacity of the habitat to support insect vectors and reservoir hosts (the long-term host of a pathogen of an infectious disease). In cultivated ecosystems such as arable agriculture, micro-organisms have been introduced for biological control of plant pathogens such as bacteria and fungi. The main mechanism of biological control is that the introduced micro-organisms compete with the pathogens for finite resources like nutrient sources provided by the seed or plant. Alternatively, resistance to diseases can be induced in plants through previous treatment with a pathogen, an attenuated version of the pathogen or a chemical, that is not a pesticide. Underlying asset components include policies that influence human population size such as migration, patterns of energy production/consumption, food production and overall demand for natural resources. These human-induced changes can cause the quality of the regulation of the disease transmission cycle to change. For example, such changes may lead to the destabilization of natural equilibria which keep populations of disease vectors in check, improving conditions for disease transmission and elevating risks to humans. Human activities that alter natural ecosystems such as human settlement building, deforestation, dam construction and reservoir flooding, as well as irrigation schemes can drive the spatiotemporal patterns of disease and its contact with humans. The minimum conditions to maintain the service are limiting the availability of suitable habitat for disease vectors and the area of reservoir hosts of infection. This includes maintaining integrity and connectivity of habitats as fragmentation opens up forest edges and exposes humans to novel diseases."
Fibres and other materials,Direct Physical Input,"The main assets of this system are macro and microalgae, wild and domestic plant species and (vegetated) habitats including farmlands and plantations, and wild and domestic animal species. Macro algae consist of red, brown and green algae, and micro algae, consist of the blue-green algae (cyanobacteria), brown (diatoms) and dinoflagellates. All algae contain chlorophyll for photosynthesis and are aquatic species. Algal compounds, when extracted, have a myriad of direct uses in medical and pharmacological applications and in further processing in the food and cosmetic industries. Algae also provide soil fertility leading to improved plant productivity in agricultural systems. The minimum conditions to maintain the service are sunlight and carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and water for nutrient extraction. Most green algae require moderate to bright light, while red and brown species will thrive in low to medium light levels. Cellulose is the main ingredient of all vegetable fibres, while tannin is a common plant-based dyeing material. Underlying asset components include, plants convert light energy to chemical energy in a process called photosynthesis. Green components, i.e. green leaves, which are the primary photosynthetic organs enabling the production of cellulose, a carbohydrate stored in the bark, roots, wood or leaves of plants. Major uses are for paper, timber, fuel wood and charcoal, cotton etc.  Tannins are found in the same parts of the plant as well as other growing parts. Photosynthetic efficiency determines the amount of biomass created, hence the growth rate of the plant and its component parts. Other assets derived from plants include: plant-based compost to enhance soil fertility, the provision of plant-based starches, important sources of food energy, grasses and fodder legumes, used for fodder purposes (pastures and meadows), cellulose, which is the main constituent of wood and paper and wood pellet and chip for fuel in biomass burners. Starches and cellulose are both natural polymers and hold promise for replacing non-renewable petroleum based polymers as an input to making plastics and fuel. Pests and disease can reduce the quality of fibres and other materials that plants provide. Secondary chemical compounds in plants form the basis of much of the world’s pharmaceutical industry - traditional and western medicines, and insecticides as well. Vegetated habitats support the plants that provide fibres, tannins and secondary compounds. The minimum conditions to maintain the service flow are healthy soil, adequate light and a water supply and an absence of alien invasive species (or plant diseases) leading to reduction in survival. Protein fibres come from the wool and hair of animals. Strong elastic fibrous secretion of silkworm larvae in cocoons is used to create silk. Compounds or bioactive natural substances extracted from tropical marine sponges have been used successfully in the pharmaceutical industry and there continues to be many more sponges of potential medicinal value undergoing clinical trials. The highest concentration of toxic or antioxidant sponge metabolites are found in habitats such as coral reefs that are characterized by intense competition and feeding pressure from fish. Animal proteins, such as skins, form strong, flexible, resistant materials such as leather. Tallow, i.e. animal fats, is used as a food additive or a lubricant. The quality of ambergris is not dependent on the asset, i.e. certain species of sperm whale, as it is an excretory product of the asset, but it depends on the salt water conditions and ageing process post–excretion. The minimum conditions to maintain the service flow are surface and ground water, essential chemicals and an energy source. A further asset is animal-derived manure from livestock and used to improve soil fertility, fishmeal from dried fish remains used as a protein supplement in livestock feed, and bone meal from slaughtered animals that is used as a nutritional supplement and a soil fertiliser. The minimum conditions for maintaining these latter services are healthy, well-nourished livestock devoid of microbial infection."
Filtration,Mitigates Direct Impacts,"There are multiple components within ecosystems that can contribute to filtering, sequestering, storing, and accumulating pollutants. Micro-organisms and plants present in wetlands (natural and man-made), forests, and peatlands, for example, are good at capturing, storing and filtering pollutants such as heavy metals, pesticides, fertilizers and CO2. Underlying asset components include, algae, animals, microorganisms and vascular and non-vascular plants. The minimum condition required for maintaining the service provision is the maintenance of environmental conditions that enable the underlying components to survive and function adequately."
Flood and storm protection,Protection from Disruption,"Flood and storm protection is provided by the sheltering, buffering and attenuating effects of natural and planted vegetation. The assets providing this service are therefore vegetated habitats and ecosystems, such as forests, mangrove forests, dunes, wetlands, among others. Underlying asset components include, well-functioning watersheds and intact floodplains and coasts provide water storage, flood control and coastal defence. Trees and woody decries on floodplains increase hydraulic roughness, slowing down flood flows and enhancing flood storage. Sand dunes, saltmarshes, and reefs provide flood protection. Inland forests reducing the risks of consequent flooding by acting as a buffer to storms and water surge. Natural floodplains such as riparian forests and wetlands are essential to flood prevention. Wetlands can attenuate waves, lower storm surge levels, and provide stability to the outer slopes of dikes. Wetlands provide flood control, a physical factor that depends on location and structure of the watershed, and which can be enhanced or altered by presence of plants to slow down currents. Mangrove forests protect coastlines from storms by buffering the impacts of storms. They attenuate wind velocity, provide protection from wind damage and reduce storm surge peak water levels. Wide mangrove belts (thousands of meters across) can be effective in reducing the flooding impacts of storm surges occurring during major storms. Narrower mangrove belts, hundreds of meters wide, will still be able to reduce wind speed, the impact of waves on top of the surge and flooding impact to some degree. The minimum conditions for maintaining the service flow are strong and sufficient vegetation as part of healthy ecosystems."
Genetic materials ,Direct Physical Input,"Genetic material is understood to be deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and all biota includes plants, animals and algae. Genetic engineering uses genetic materials, derived from plants, animals and algae, to make useful products in medicine, research, industry and agriculture. The asset of this system is therefore DNA and its replication, manipulation and insertion in the genetic material of another host organism is the service. From this service there is a myriad of downstream products and applications. For plant genetic material, the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) estimates that, since the beginning of the 20th century, about 75 percent of the genetic diversity of agricultural crops has been lost. Animal genetic material provides the raw material for breed improvement and for the adaptation of livestock populations to changing environments and changing demand, i.e. increased resilience. Genetic material from algal species, such as cyanobacteria, provides a number of important services from bioremediation of contaminated soils to improved nitrogen enrichment of plants through nitrogen fixation. Genetic breeding of brown algae has increased the yield of edible seaweed in China from 10 tonnes dry weight in 1952 to 350,000 tonnes currently. The minimum conditions for maintaining this service flow are the stability of the genetic material so that it can be passed on to the next generation without degradation and so that it is exactly replicable. Genetic diversity, although not a minimum condition for the maintenance of this service, is essential for the quality of the service flow, i.e. the higher diversity of the genetic material, the more resilient and adaptable the biota. For example, the quality/availability of commercial plant-based genetic material is determined by its genetic uniformity, i.e. how many wild plant varieties are interbred. Without genetic diversity in commercial plant genetic material, crops would be more susceptible to disease and crop failure."
Ground water,Direct Physical Input,"Groundwater is water stored underground in aquifers made of permeable rocks, soil and sand. The water that contributes to groundwater sources originates from rainfall, snow melts and water flow from natural freshwater resources. Rainwater flows through the soil surface into aquifers during a process called infiltration. This water is either extracted or flows out of aquifers into surface water bodies or soils, and eventually either evaporates or is returned to the ocean to complete the global hydrological cycle. Geophysical characteristics of groundwater bodies (e.g. aquifers) and surface water bodies (e.g. rivers and wetlands) control water volume, infiltration, storage and replenishment of groundwater stocks, as well as subsequent provision of groundwater to other water bodies. Other underlying asset components are rainfall, as the asset that enables replenishment of groundwater sources, and vegetation and soils, which affect the volume of water that reaches aquifers through infiltration. The minimum conditions to maintain the service flow are: maintenance of water level (i.e. provision from rainfall needs to exceed groundwater abstraction resulting from natural process or human use) and maintenance of groundwater quality (e.g. physical properties of aquifers and soils that enable infiltration; chemical properties of water)."
Maintain nursery habitats,Enables Production Process,"Nurseries are habitats that make a significantly high contribution to the reproduction of individuals from a particular species, where juveniles occur at higher densities, avoid predation more successfully, or grow faster than in other habitats. These are critical spaces for eggs, larvae, juveniles and sub-adults, providing food, shelter, space and pathways among habitats. Marine nurseries provide economic, health and recreational benefits. As most species use nursery areas during their life cycle, the majority of marine species of commercial and subsistence fishing rely on nursery areas to generate a variety of seafood products. Equally, recreational fishing and coastal tourism depend on these habitats. Specifically marine habitats, such as estuaries, shallow banks, coastal forests and wetlands, marshes, mangrove forests, coral and rock reefs, seamounts, macroalgae and seagrass meadows, and static portions of the ocean comprise marine nurseries. The underlying asset components of nurseries include: shallow waters in habitats such as saltmarshes that provide protection; the physico-chemical properties of water - nutrients such as carbon, phosphorus and nitrogen are produced in vast quantities by wetlands and sea grass and exported to other coastal food webs; disturbance and tidal regime; structural complexity and spatial pattern of the habitats providing protection from predation and increasing survivorship; underpinning of biotic communities: larval supply, predation, competition, food availability, community structure complexity; and water depth and quality. The minimum conditions needed to maintain nursery populations are healthy habitats, ocean currents providing linkages between habitats,
and adequate water quality, depth and nutrients. "
Mass stabilisation and erosion control,Protection from Disruption,"Mass stabilisation and erosion control is delivered through vegetated habitats, land geomorphology, and soils and sediments. Plant root systems provide slope stability and soil erosion control. Plants shelter and fix soil with their roots, protecting soil against erosion by reducing water runoff. Vegetation also acts as a physical barrier to sediment flow at the soil surface. Grass roots increase top soil resistance against erosion by concentrated flow. Deep-rooted trees and shrubs can help reduce shallow landslides by strengthening the soil layers and improving drainage. Forests also attenuate and block debris flow and rock falls by forming a physical barrier. The vegetation canopy reduces the energy of raindrops against the soil, especially in multi-layered forests. Top soil cover provided by plants and other organisms. Several species of soil algae form a layer over land, as a form of surface cover, which reduces soil losses in comparison with the losses from bare lands. Soil properties such as salinity, texture, aggregations, strength, content, and infiltration capacities determine effects of root systems properties, resistance to raindrop impact, and resistance to soil break up and gully formation, among others. Runoff systems manage runoff concentrations to prevent saturation of soil resulting in erosion or landslides. In coastal systems, mangrove forests protect coastlines from erosion; these dense forests reduce the impact of waves and prevent erosion by increasing friction and reducing storm surge peak water levels. Their root structure reduces erosion and tidal and wave energy are dissipated to lower levels, protecting the shoreline and allowing salt marshes and reeds to grow which in turn reduces erosion. Soil condition is an important factors affecting the erodibility of mangrove soils. Coral reefs are critical in reducing coast erosion from high frequency wave events by significantly reducing swell waves. Oyster reefs influence water flow in estuaries and stabilize intertidal sediments in these environments, providing mass stabilization and erosion control. Beaches and sand dunes provide sediment stabilization, soil retention in vegetation root structure this control coastal erosion. Sea grass beds and saltmarshes provide attenuation of waves, stabilization of sediments by roots and rhizomes and their debris, thus controlling coastal erosion. The minimum conditions for maintaining the service flow are well-structured soils and sediments, stable land geomorphology, sufficient vegetation cover as part of healthy ecosystems, and adequate root systems for the soil type."
Mediation of sensory impacts,Mitigates Direct Impacts,"Noise, smell and visual mediation is critical in attenuating major health, socioeconomic and general well-being problems faced in most urbanized settings. Light pollution impacts human health by alteration of melatonin production and circadian rhythms which may cause sleep, metabolic, performance and alertness disorders. Noise can have serious effects human health, both auditory (hearing loss and change in sound perception) and non-auditory (sleep disturbance, annoyance, heart disease and cognitive impairment). Noise and ecological light pollution alters natural regimes in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and can affect foraging, orientation, reproduction, communication and other critical behaviours. Vegetation is the main (natural) barrier used to reduce noise and light pollution, limiting the impact it can have on human health and the environment. Green belts around highways, green spaces in cities, hedges and other types of vegetation barriers can reduce noise pollution by diffracting, reflecting, and absorbing light and sound waves. The assets providing this service are surface water; vegetation (wild and domestic plants); and the habitats that support these. Vegetation contributes to decrease in urban noise. The level of this decrease depends on the type of vegetation (species), and characteristics of the green infrastructure (thickness and height of vegetation). Location and structure of vegetation is important for the ability to filter air. Distance to the source of impact (noise, smell, visual) is a key factor in the mitigation capacity of the asset. The characteristics of the ground and surrounding environment and structures of urban spaces influences the quality of the service. Air pollution (smells) is greatly reduced by vegetation. The local situation will determine the level of this service. Certain types of vegetation will have greater filtering capacities given their leaf area. Different species of vegetation will also differ in their sensitivity to pollution and capacity of gas absorption. Water provision for structures such as fountains, artificial and natural urban and suburban streams is important in mediating noise pollution. The minimum conditions for maintaining the service flow are adequate green infrastructure (urban forests, gardens, hedges, green walls, green roofs etc.), water provision, and healthy sub-urban and rural ecosystems."
Pest control,Protection from Disruption,"Pest control and invasive alien species management is provided through a range of natural assets. These include direct introduction and maintenance of populations of the predators of the pest or the invasive species, landscaping areas to encourage habitats for pest reduction, e.g. through habitat creation for their predators or planting relevant food plants or plants that flower and attract relevant insects, and the manufacture of a family of natural biocides (algicide, fungicide, herbicide, insecticide, molluscicide, pesticide) based on natural toxins to pests. In the marine realm, the cleansing of invasive species-laden ballast water, through its exchange at sea before port arrival, is the only widely practised remedy for invasive species management. This has however had limited success and has been responsible for the introduction of invasive species in the Baltic Sea where up to 13 species have been introduced via ballast or as attachments to the bottom of ships. Invasive species prevention, in a whole-ecosystem context, must take into account food web and functional role frameworks in order to maintain healthy interactions at different trophic levels. For example the removal of a native, grazing herbivore can heighten the risk of invasions of alien plants. Predator-prey interactions are a key component in pest management strategies, especially in agro-ecological systems. Habitat restoration is an important component. For example, remnant forest or planted woody vegetation adjacent to vineyards can increase predation of eggs of a vineyard insect pest, Epiphyas postvittana. Disturbed and non-restored habitats are more susceptible to colonisation by invasive species, e.g. human-made habitats such as farmland and urban landscapes also facilitate the spread of alien plants. Habitat characteristics, such as climate, soil nutrients, existing flora and human impact determine the habitat’s vulnerability to invasions. Mountains, cliffs, bogs, dry grasslands and coniferous woodlands tend to resist alien invasion, while coastal and riverine habitats, where nutrient availability and disturbance can be high, are more prone to invasion by alien plants. The minimum conditions to maintain pest control are limiting pathways for invasive species spread and maintaining predator-prey interactions. Pests and invasive species are particularly likely to spread in locations where there are few species and little competition (e.g. islands) or in locations of high turnover and instability (e.g. river margins, wetlands, coasts)."
Pollination,Enables Production Process,"Pollination refers to the movement of pollen from the male part of flowers (the stamens) to the female part that contains the ovules. Pollination services are provided by three main mechanisms: animals, water and wind. The majority of plants (90% of wild flowering plant species and 75% of global food crops) depend to some extent on animals that act as vectors, or pollinators, to perform the transfer of pollen. Wind- and water-mediated pollination do occur, however they are less efficient and are not primary mechanisms of pollination for plants. Wind plays a minor role in pollination of certain cereals, but it is important for almost all conifer species. Animal pollinators include species of insects, birds, mammals (e.g. bats, primates, marsupials, rodents), and reptiles. The largest group of pollinators is comprised of insects, of which bees are the most important. Over 90% of the world’s leading global crop types are visited by bees. Some bee species are managed by humans to enable pollination of certain crops, but the vast majority of pollinating bee species are wild (i.e. free-living and unmanaged). Pollination is a key ecosystem service for companies within the agricultural and luxury goods industries. The annual contribution of pollinators to the global economy equates to US$235 – 577 billion (using 2015 data). Underlying asset components include: healthy populations of wild and managed insects, birds, mammals, fish, and reptiles; wind processes for wind-based pollination; and water bodies for water-based pollination. The minimum conditions for maintenance of service flow are the survival of pollinating species and the free movement of pollinating species. Post-pollination, seed dispersal refers to the movement of mature seeds away from the parent plant to allow colonisation of new areas, better chances of survival, and higher genetic diversity. Seeds can be dispersed by three major actors: animals, wind, and water . The act of seed dispersal by animals is referred to as zoochory and is performed by insects, birds, mammals, fish, and reptiles. Seeds can be dispersed unintentionally within species when seeds or fruits are ingested (referred to as endozoochory), attached to species (e.g. in fur or feathers; referred to as epizoochory), or intentionally carried in the mouths of birds and bats, or by humans (referred to as synzoochory). The main determinants in seed dispersal by wind are plant height and surrounding vegetation, both of which influence the distance that seeds can be dispersed to – the higher the plant and the more open the habitat, the further seeds can be dispersed."
Soil quality,Enables Production Process,"The processes of weathering are critical to soil formation, and maintenance of soil properties as nutrient composition and structure. Physical or mechanical weathering processes are provided through frost action or frost shattering, volume changes of minerals, or exfoliation as a consequence of pressure changes. Chemical weathering occurs when rainwater reacts with mineral grains in rocks and generate chemical processes as oxidation, hydrolysis, solution, carbonation, etc., which are facilitated by higher temperatures. Organic or biological weathering are provided by the biotic communities in and on the soil by processes such as root wedging, animal scraping or the production of organic acids.The assets providing this service are therefore elements of the climate system; non-metallic mineral resources, soil and surface water; top-soil; soil biodiversity such as fungi, microorganisms, invertebrates and plants; and the land geomorphology that supports these. Climate dictates what type of weathering processes operate, by determining the amount of water available and the temperature by which processes occur. Temperature and moisture will change speed of chemical can biological reactions in weathering processes. Rainfall influences the intensity of weathering and the leaching of weathering products. Mineralogy of the parent material influences weathering products and mineral composition of soil. Rock type and structure. Different materials weather in different ways and at different rates depending on its composition. Water drives mechanical and chemical weathering and can facilitate organic weathering by supporting the biotic community. Plants can create organic compounds that alter weathering rates and roots can disaggregate rock, and influence soil structure, formation and other processes. Plants can enhance weathering through the penetration of roots and root-derived acids. Fungal biomass in the soil influences soil composition and plants capacity to disaggregate rock fragments. Water, plants and soil fauna translocate minerals and other compounds product of weathering through the soil. Arthropods and other soil invertebrates produce organic compounds, which promote weathering. They contribute to paedogenesis (soil formation) by bioturbation, surface deposition and particle selection. The minimum conditions for maintaining the service flow are: mineral parent material and weathering agents. Maintenance of bio-geochemical conditions of soils by decomposition and fixation (decomposition/mineralisation of dead organic material, nitrification, denitrification etc. and nitrogen-fixing and other bio-geochemical processes) are also key functions in maintaining ecosystems, ensuring fertility, water purification, and nutrient transformation. The assets providing this service are therefore soil and surface water; top-soil; soil biodiversity such as fungi, microorganisms, invertebrates and plants; the interactions between them and the habitats that support these. The minimum conditions for maintaining decomposition and fixation service flow are: a healthy soil macro and micro biotic community, appropriate organic and inorganic conditions of soil."
Surface water,Direct Physical Input,"Surface water is provided through freshwater resources from collected precipitation and water flow from natural sources. Surface water is a key resource for many industries, including most notably the agriculture, energy production and tourism industries. Physical water bodies are the assets that enable the provision of surface water. The main types of water bodies are rivers, lakes, streams, reservoirs, canals, transitional waters and coastal waters. In essence they are the “vessels” through which surface water is provided and their physical characteristics result from underlying geological features. Underlying geological features are the characteristics such as slope, size and shape of river basins, streams, and channels that shape water bodies. These features also influence the flow (i.e. speed) and volume or amount of water that flows through water bodies. The volume or amount of water flowing through water bodies determines the quantity of surface water provided to catchments or watersheds and the speed at which it is provided. The minimum conditions to maintain the service flow are maintenance of biological quality (e.g. through the presence of fish), chemical properties, hydromorphological properties such as size and shape of streams and channels, and the flow and quantity of water (e.g. from rainfall). "
Ventilation,Enables Production Process,"The process of water moving through the plant and back out into the atmosphere is called transpiration. Transpiration increases the relative humidity of surrounding air, e.g. an acre of corn transpires about 3,000- 4,000 gallons (11,400-15,100 litres) of water per day. It is an essential part of the global water cycle, accounting for about 10 percent of the moisture found in the atmosphere. The process of transpiration is enabled through pores on the underside of the plant leaf called stomata. It has been estimated that, globally, transpiration recycles 62,000 ± 8,000 km3 of water per year to the atmosphere, using half of all solar energy absorbed by land surfaces in the process. Ventilation is vital for good indoor air quality and without it there are long term health implications for building occupants due to the build-up of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), airborne bacteria and moulds. Although laboratory based studies have shown compelling evidence for the removal of VOCs from air in closed chambers by plants, there is little evidence to support this in actual field studies in residential and commercial buildings. However some statistically significant demonstrations of VOC removal by plants, at 100 parts per billion (ppb) have been shown in in office spaces in Australia. The agents responsible for VOC removal appear to be the species-specific communities of root-zone (rhizosphere) microorganisms, residing in the soil potting mixture. The type of plant is also important as some plants transpire less than others, for example arid plants like cacti transpire less in order to conserve moisture. Rhizosphere microorganisms appear to consume VOCs through catabolic processes for use in respiration. Meteorological conditions of the atmosphere are the minimum conditions for transpiration in plants. These include temperature, relative humidity, wind and air movement as well as soil moisture availability. Concentration, temperature, and moisture control the specific rates of VOC consumption by soil microorganisms."
Water flow maintenance,Enables Production Process,"The hydrological cycle, also called water cycle or hydrologic cycle, is the system that enables circulation of water through the Earth’s atmosphere, land, and oceans. The hydrological cycle refers to the way water evaporates from vegetation, streams, soil and oceans, condenses into rain drops, snow or hail, and returns to the Earth’s surface through precipitation. Consequently, the hydrological cycle is responsible for recharge of groundwater sources (i.e. aquifers) and maintenance of surface water flows. The underlying asset components include water flow and water volume. Water flow, the flow of water through landscapes, is an essential asset in the function of the hydrological cycle and relies upon physical characteristics of the Earth, for example global temperature, topographical, geological, atmospheric features which enable water to flow through landscapes from when it falls to the ground as rain, snow, or hail through to when it evaporates again; nutrient cycles, which influence water quality when water travels through landscapes; and solar energy, which influences evaporation, precipitation, and melting of snows. Water volume is an important component that determines the amount of water flowing through landscapes and is affected by evaporation rates and precipitation patterns. The minimum conditions required to maintain the service flow is the maintenance of natural weather cycles and flow of water through landscapes."
Water quality,Enables Production Process,"Salt water covers 70% of the planet’s surface and is a mixture of water (96.5%), salt (2.5%), and small amounts of other substances such as gases (e.g. CO2), chemical particles from organic and inorganic materials, and particulates. Salt water is present in the ocean, seas, estuaries, and salt lakes. Salinity varies as a result of rainfall, evaporation, runoff and ice freezing and melting. Animals and plant species also contribute to maintenance of salt water condition by abstracting nutrients (e.g. nitrogen and phosphorous) and moving particles. The minimum condition for the maintenance of salt water service flow is continued balance of nutrients, salinity, pH, chemical particles, and movement of particles through currents. The chemical condition of freshwaters, including rivers, streams, lakes, and ground water sources, depends on the natural physical and chemical processes that maintain quality of freshwater. Physical characteristics include local topography, soil type, bedrock, vegetation, and climate. Chemical processes include nutrient balances and chemical properties, and are influenced by physical processes. Freshwater plant and animal species also have a role to play in maintaining chemical condition of freshwaters, for example by preventing carbon build-up in riverbeds or capturing excess nutrients and pollutants. The chemical condition of freshwaters can be particularly affected by certain industries (e.g. energy production) when wastewaters are returned to water bodies, thus altering temperature and pH, which can in some cases be beneficial to certain species (e.g. if waste water is returned cleaner than when abstracted due to regulations such as the European Union Water Framework Directive), whilst detrimental to others. The minimum condition required to enable freshwater service flow is the maintenance of natural chemical processes and species survival."
