Animal-based energy,"Some animals are used in tasks such as ploughing or logging due to their sheer physical strength. Such animals are grouped as a draught or draft animals, for example horses, oxen, elephant and camels. Others may be used as pack animals, for animal-powered transport, the movement of people and goods. People ride some animals directly as mounts; alternatively, one or more animals in harness may be used to pull vehicles.

As such, animal-based energy is highly sensitive to changes in animal abundance, however these changes can be reversed if the condition animals are living in are improved, such as disease reduction. Animal-based energy cannot be replaced by anything as only animals can provide this service. There is low uncertainty in the relationship between animal-based energy and species because they are intrinsically linked. ",Diseases,R,"Increased connectivity of global human populations has increased the frequency and magnitude of disease outbreaks. Disease vectors and pathogens can impact all species, and cause dramatic shifts in community structure, biodiversity ecosystem function and services, and human health. However, individual responses to diseases varies by species. Aspects of population biology are heavily researched, however the ecological and evolutionary impact of diseases, especially in marine environments, remain unknown. There is a paucity of baseline and epidemiological information on normal disease levels, which would aid understanding of pathogen transmission and host resistance.","Draught animals are rarely kept in herds, often kept apart from other animals, and are often in remote areas but may travel considerable distances and congregate in local markets. When an animal dies in the middle of a cultivation season it is difficult to borrow or hire another, because animal power is in demand. Ultimately reduced work output can be reflected in reduced farm productivity.","Service provision will decline in infected animals, e.g. cost of working oxen affected by bovine dermatophilosis in Zambia was USD 193 per affected ox.",Natural variation,Short term,Global

Buffering and attenuation of mass flows,"Buffering and attenuation of mass flows is delivered through vegetated habitats, and soils and sediments. Underlying asset components include, Vegetated buffer strips along lakes and streams protect and improve water quality by filtering sediments, stabilizing stream banks and shorelines and preventing erosion. Vegetation, ideally forests, in upper catchments helps stop mass flow and erosion. Trees and woody decries on floodplains increases hydraulic roughness, slowing down flood flows and enhancing flood storage. Vegetation (forests) can affect the likelihood of an avalanche release and can protect human settlements and infrastructure . Plant root systems along bodies of water provide slope stability and soil erosion control. Plants shelter and fix soil with their roots, protecting soil against erosion by reducing water runoff. In coastal systems, mangrove forests protect coastlines from erosion; these dense forests reduce the impact of waves and prevent erosion by increasing friction and reducing storm surge peak water levels. Tidal and wave energy are dissipated to lower levels, protecting the shoreline and allowing salt marshes and reeds to grow which in turn reduces erosion. Run-off systems manage runoff concentrations to prevent saturation of soil resulting in erosion or landslides. Top soil cover provided by plants and other organisms.

As soil is dried out, plant growth is reduced, which reduces the stability of the surface layer and leads to erosion. Desertification is a more extreme version of this process, where soils that lose stable plant communities become unstable themselves, and subsequently start to shift around. In contrast, increases in precipitation can cause changes to soil texture and structure, with increases in run-off causing reduction in top soil (which is often the most productive part of a soil horizon).

Climate regulation,"Approximately one third of global anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are sequestered by the oceans. The main processes involved in water-based carbon sequestration are carbon storage in sediments, carbon sequestration in the water column, and air-sea CO2 exchange. Micro-algae such as ocean phytoplankton absorb considerable amounts of greenhouse gas emissions (CO2) through photosynthesis. Dead phytoplankton carry this carbon to the seabed, where it is trapped in seabed sediment along with methane gas released when the planktonic organisms are decomposing. These deposited gases are locked in the sediment at extremely high pressures and create a vast carbon store which can remain undisturbed for geological timescales. Carbon captured by other marine biota, such as in marine vegetated habitats like mangroves, is known as blue carbon. Most of the carbon is in the anaerobic mud that supports mangroves - this can be meters deep. This blue carbon accounts for 50% of carbon burial in marine sediments. Transport of carbon in the water column and into oceans via Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) is another part of this system. The DOC comprises the vast majority of the organic matter in the oceanic water column originating from freshwater runoff, microscopic plants that live in the bottom of the ocean, and phytoplankton. The provision of organic material to ocean sediments is the major driver of the quality of the organic carbon content of the oceans. It is composed of marine and terrestrial organic content in roughly equal amounts. Marine dissolved organic material (DOM) is produced in-situ by dead photosynthetic plankton and other oceanic plants and animals. Terrestrial organic carbon is supplied to ocean sediment by rivers, winds, and in high latitudes by icebergs or sea ice. Ocean circulation is the primary driver of oceanic CO2 uptake via air-sea carbon exchange. Terrestrial sediment, transported to the sea by freshwater flows, drives the occurrence of marine vegetated habitats in coastal settings. Therefore the quantity and stability of these sediment flows is a determinant of the carbon stored in their sediment. For burial of sources of organic carbon, a minimum condition is the build-up of sediments on the ocean shelf slopes which cascade down the shelf as turbidites - burying the organic material on the deep sea floor. The adverse effect of increasing seasonality on the transfer efficiency of carbon to the deep sea is tentatively attributed to greater biodegradability of organic matter exported during bloom events. The transfer efficiency of organic carbon increases with the flux of carbonate and decreases with water depth and seasonality. The sequestration rate of the ocean is strongly determined by the downward movement of surface water to the depths. This occurs at a rate fast enough across most of the world’s oceans where the balance of CO2 between the upper ocean layer and the atmosphere is roughly in equilibrium.

Climate regulation,"Approximately one third of global anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are sequestered by the oceans. The main processes involved in water-based carbon sequestration are carbon storage in sediments, carbon sequestration in the water column, and air-sea CO2 exchange. Micro-algae such as ocean phytoplankton absorb considerable amounts of greenhouse gas emissions (CO2) through photosynthesis. Dead phytoplankton carry this carbon to the seabed, where it is trapped in seabed sediment along with methane gas released when the planktonic organisms are decomposing. These deposited gases are locked in the sediment at extremely high pressures and create a vast carbon store which can remain undisturbed for geological timescales. Carbon captured by other marine biota, such as in marine vegetated habitats like mangroves, is known as blue carbon. Most of the carbon is in the anaerobic mud that supports mangroves - this can be meters deep. This blue carbon accounts for 50% of carbon burial in marine sediments.

Terrestrial organic carbon is supplied to ocean sediment by rivers, winds, and in high latitudes by icebergs or sea ice. Ocean circulation is the primary driver of oceanic CO2 uptake via air-sea carbon exchange. Terrestrial sediment, transported to the sea by freshwater flows, drives the occurrence of marine vegetated habitats in coastal settings. Therefore the quantity and stability of these sediment flows is a determinant of the carbon stored in their sediment.

Industrial processes however have far exceeded natural emissions so that they can no longer be absorbed and broken down by natural atmospheric processes at the same rate as they are being emitted. Instead they are only being dispersed and diluted throughout the atmosphere. Atmospheric conditions, such as cloud cover, wind speed, vertical temperature profile, turbulence levels and surface radiation are the main system components influencing the quality of the asset. The emission height influences the availability of the asset, i.e. whether the pollutants are emitted at the ground level or from taller objects such as chimneys. Local and regional topography also plays a role, such as the presence of hills and valleys. The nature of the pollutant source, whether it is diffuse or a point, may determine the asset quality. The minimum conditions maintaining the dilution service is the action of transport and dispersion, i.e. horizontal wind movement across the surface of the Earth and vertical movement up to the maximum limit of the atmosphere. Wind direction and speed is also important.",Clean air,Atmosphere,R,"There is a linear relationship between dilution by atmosphere and the atmosphere as they are directly linked. Dilution by atmosphere is highly sensitive to changes in the atmosphere as cloud cover, wind speed, vertical temperature profile and turbulence levels are the main system components influencing the service.

Greenhouse gases remain the largest and most important driver of global warming and atmospheric change, consequently the atmosphere has a high susceptibility to emission based drivers of change. Despite these figures, there is a lack of consistent and comprehensive assessments of the emission effects on the atmosphere by the transport sector in isolation, resulting in large variability in predictions relating to the impact of human movements on the atmosphere.

It is estimated that extreme climate processes, such as the El Nino Southern Oscillation, will increase as a result of associated global warming changing convection currents in both the oceans and the atmosphere. Evolving international and domestic regulations and policies in favour of environmentally friendly technology means that the relationship between the atmosphere and industry cannot be predicted with a high degree of certainty over an extended period of time and that there is a high degree of variability between prediction models.

Dilution by atmosphere and ecosystems,"The main asset of this system is saline water which constitutes 96.5% of the total water on Earth. The minimum conditions for maintaining the service flow are the ambient density stratification of the seawater and local currents. Stratification occurs when water masses of different characteristics, e.g. salinity, oxygenation or temperature differences, form layers which don’t mix well. The least favourable stratification conditions are those which create the lowest potential for dilution. Therefore maximum seawater vertical density stratification results in minimum dilution. Sea water density in turn is determined by salinity. Salinity variations are driven by precipitation, evaporation, runoff and ice freezing and melting. Underlying asset components include the stratification of sea water which is driven by density, salinity and temperature and surface wind direction and strength. In the deep ocean, a minimum condition for the dilution of at-sea pollutants, such as radioactive waste, is the horizontal and vertical velocities of the currents. Analysis of pollution dispersal shows that the horizontal transport is more significant in the upper ocean layers than in deep ones. Therefore pollutants can be delivered to the deep layers not through deep-water horizontal transport, but rather as a result of vertical downwelling from the already contaminated upper layers. ",Clean water,Ocean geomorphology,A,"There is a non-linear relationship between dilution by marine ecosystems and ocean geomorphology as they are not directly linked. Dilution by marine ecosystems is sensitive to changes in ocean geomorphology as changes can impact how quickly and efficiently pollutants are diluted. The changes may be reversed if coastal protection structures are replaced by natural alternatives, for example mangrove forests. Ocean geomorphology is a supporting asset for dilution by marine ecosystems as a service. There is low uncertainty in the relationship between dilution by marine ecosystems and ocean geomorphology. ",Industrial or domestic activities,A,"Industrial activities do not have a significant impact on large geomorphological structures such as trenches and seamounts. However, industrial and domestic activities have significant impacts on shallow water areas. Boom trawling greatly damages coral beds killing corals and destroying mineralised ocean structures, altering the geomorphology of reefs. Additionally, industrial and domestic clearance and pollution of coastal habitats, such as mangrove forest and saltmarsh, has resulted in the loss of important buffering processes that protect coastal structures from physical damage and alteration. With rising sea levels and increased storm frequency and intensity, negative impacts of industrial and domestic activity will continue to increase with low variability and uncertainty.

",Fire,R,"In the short term, fires rapidly reduce habitat availability (and in turn reduce available food, shelter, refuges) - patches that do remain are often isolated and undesirable. More intense fires change multiple aspects of vegetation structure - foliage and vegetation is stripped and killed, and soil will be exposed leading to higher rates of erosion. However, fire is a widely used management regime, and restoration of vegetation post-fire can often lead to increases in habitat availability and quality, e.g. through reducing litter and dead vegetation. Fire plays a role in maintaining natural heterogeneity in the environment, and this disturbance-mediated heterogeneity leads to a mosaic of habitats or successional stages that support species. Fire does not only simplify vegetative structure and remove plant species; it also creates new habitat features. It is difficult to obtain a full history of fire events, as many fires go unrecorded. In addition some indicators (such as fire scars) can be unreliable - for example, trees are commonly charred but not scarred, and shallow scars may also be burned away by subsequent fires. Therefore there is uncertainty in the relationship.",There will be a reduction in plant based fibre material post fire and during recovery period.,Imbalances in the fire cycle caused by extreme weather such as drought can create severe fires which affect provision of fibre and other plant based materials.,Natural variation,Long-term,"Global - grasslands, shrub lands and forests"
Fibres and other materials,"The main assets of this system are macro algae, consisting of red, brown and green algae, and micro algae, consisting of the blue-green algae (cyanobacteria), brown (diatoms) and dinoflagellates. Macro algae are multicellular and appear plant like while micro algae are unicellular species which exist individually, or in chains or groups, sometimes known as phytoplankton. All algae contain chlorophyll for photosynthesis and are aquatic species. The main service provided by this system is the provision of algal compounds, which are predominately extracted from seawater by marine algae. These compounds, when extracted, have a myriad of direct uses in medical and pharmacological applications and in further processing in the food and cosmetic industries. Compounds extracted from macroalgae have antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral properties which can be used in medicine while microalgae such as Spirulina platensis can be ingested directly as a human nutritional supplement. Carageenins extracted from Chondrus crispis, a micro algae, are widely used as gelling agents in the food industry. Underlying asset components include the brown algae, kelp, is widely harvested as it is rich in iodine and alginates (kelp-derived carbohydrates). The kelp components –flat or leaf-like structures known as blades, the holdfast which anchors the blades and the air-filled bladders which keep it close to the surface – are harvested from the seabed partly or totally depending on the technique used. Alginates are used in food and drink, cosmetics etc. The antimicrobial action of iodine means that it is commonly used as a disinfectant in medical procedures. Elemental iodine may also be used to treat iodine deficiency. Other macro algal components of this system are the carrageenans, which are polysaccharides extracted from red algae, and alginates from the brown algae. Both are used in the cosmetics and food industries principally as thickening agents. The main component of the micro algal asset, the cyanobacteria, are the pharmacologically active compounds from which antibiotics are extracted. These are used in antimicrobials, antivirals & antifungals, neuroprotective products, therapeutic proteins and drugs. Another component is the long chain polymers, present in the algae lipids, which are used for making bioplastics, biodegradable plastic alternative to those made from petroleum. The minimum conditions to maintain the service are sunlight and carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and water for nutrient extraction. Most green algae require moderate to bright light, while red and brown species will thrive in low to medium light levels. The optimum water temperature for two species of green algae, Chlorella ellipsoidea and Nannochloris oculata, is between 15 and 25°C while salinity levels of 15 to 30 parts per thousand are best for growth rate in the most commercially important green algae, Isochrysis galbana and Tetraselmis suecica.",Raw materials,Habitats,A,There is a non-linear relationship between fibres and other materials from algae and habitats because they are not directly linked.

Fibres and other materials,"The assets underpinning the system are both wild and domestic plant species and (vegetated) habitats including farmlands and plantations. The service flow is maintained through the system by the provision of vegetable fibres from the system components – the roots, fruit, leaves, buds, seeds, and stems of plants. Other vegetable materials flow from the same components. Cellulose is the main ingredient of all vegetable fibres, while tannin is a common plant-based dyeing material. Underlying asset components include, plants convert light energy to chemical energy in a process called photosynthesis. Green components, i.e. green leaves, which are the primary photosynthetic organs enabling the production of cellulose, a carbohydrate stored in the bark, roots, wood or leaves of plants. Major uses are for paper, timber, fuel wood and charcoal, cotton etc.  Tannins are found in the same parts of the plant as well as other growing parts - buds, seeds, roots, and stem tissues. Photosynthetic efficiency determines the amount of biomass created, hence the growth rate of the plant and its component parts. Leaf health is a major determinant of the quality of all components of the plant species-based assets, both in wild and commercial species. Declines in leaf health impact the provision of the service. Pests and disease which consume only the woody parts, roots or fruits can reduce the quality of fibres and other materials they provide. Secondary chemical compounds (known as secondary metabolites) in plants form the basis of much of the world’s pharmaceutical industry - traditional and western medicines, and insecticides as well. These are organic compounds that play an important role in plant defense against herbivory and other interspecies defenses. Vegetated habitats such as forests, shrublands and grasslands support the plants that provide fibres, tannins and secondary compounds.

Fibres and other materials,"The assets underpinning the system are both wild and domestic animal species. The service flow is maintained through the system by the provision of protein fibres from the system components, for example the skin, wool and hair of animals, secretions of silkworm larvae, faecal material from whales, and sponge metabolites. Underlying asset components include, protein fibres, which come from the wool and hair of animals. Strong elastic fibrous secretion of silkworm larvae in cocoons which is used to create silk. The quality of silk is impacted by the cocoon characteristics: size, shape, fibre thickness, and length. Compounds or bioactive natural substances extracted from tropical marine sponges have been used successfully in the pharmaceutical industry and there continues to be many more sponges of potential medicinal value undergoing clinical trials. The highest concentration of toxic or antioxidant sponge metabolites are found in habitats such as coral reefs that are characterized by intense competition and feeding pressure from fish. The sponges produce high levels of cytotoxic chemicals and spread them through the emission of mucus in order to create a clear zone around it to ward off other marine species. Secondary metabolites can then protect the organism against further predation. It is these compounds which confer beneficial medicinal value in pharmaceutical products - antibacterial, antiviral, immunosuppressive etc. Animal proteins, such as skins, form strong, flexible, resistant materials such as leather. The best sources of hides and skins from domesticated animals are cattle hides and sheep-goat skins. Factors affecting the quality of hides are mechanical damage such as brand marks and diseases like ring worm, bruising and damaging of the skin, and bacterial damage and contamination. Tallow, i.e. animal fats, is used as a food additive or a lubricant. The quality of tallow depends on the production and processing procedures rather than the quality of the underlying natural asset. The quality of ambergris is not dependent on the asset, i.e. certain species of sperm whale, as it is an excretory product of the asset, but it depends on the salt water conditions and ageing process post–excretion.

Fibres and other materials,"The main assets of this system are macro algae, consisting of red, brown and green algae, and micro algae, consisting of the blue-green algae (cyanobacteria), brown (diatoms) and dinoflagellates. Macro algae are multicellular and appear plant like while micro algae are unicellular species which exist individually, or in chains or groups, sometimes known as phytoplankton. All algae contain chlorophyll for photosynthesis and are aquatic species. The main service provided by this system is the provision of algal compounds, which are predominately extracted from seawater by marine algae. These compounds, when extracted, have a myriad of direct uses in medical and pharmacological applications and in further processing in the food and cosmetic industries. Compounds extracted from macroalgae have antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral properties which can be used in medicine while microalgae such as Spirulina platensis can be ingested directly as a human nutritional supplement. Carageenins extracted from Chondrus crispis, a micro algae, are widely used as gelling agents in the food industry. Underlying asset components include the brown algae, kelp, is widely harvested as it is rich in iodine and alginates (kelp-derived carbohydrates). The kelp components –flat or leaf-like structures known as blades, the holdfast which anchors the blades and the air-filled bladders which keep it close to the surface – are harvested from the seabed partly or totally depending on the technique used. Alginates are used in food and drink, cosmetics etc. The antimicrobial action of iodine means that it is commonly used as a disinfectant in medical procedures. Elemental iodine may also be used to treat iodine deficiency. Other macro algal components of this system are the carrageenans, which are polysaccharides extracted from red algae, and alginates from the brown algae. Both are used in the cosmetics and food industries principally as thickening agents. The main component of the micro algal asset, the cyanobacteria, are the pharmacologically active compounds from which antibiotics are extracted. These are used in antimicrobials, antivirals & antifungals, neuroprotective products, therapeutic proteins and drugs. Another component is the long chain polymers, present in the algae lipids, which are used for making bioplastics, biodegradable plastic alternative to those made from petroleum. The minimum conditions to maintain the service are sunlight and carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and water for nutrient extraction. Most green algae require moderate to bright light, while red and brown species will thrive in low to medium light levels.

This can have devastating effects on shallow water corals that are induced to disassociate with photosynthesising symbionts under increased thermal conditions, resulting in bleaching and death. The destruction of coral reefs has an extensive impact on a wide range of species. Bleaching events have been extensively studied in response to spikes in sea temperature rises, yielding low variability in results and indicating a strong correlation of the relationship. Further, changes in sea surface temperatures can alter climatic conditions impacting terrestrial and marine species globally through destructive processes (droughts, hurricane etc), altering habitat ranges and ecological niche displacement.",Cyclic and fatally bleached sponge tissues had lower chlorophyll a concentrations than non-bleached tissues.,Sponge pieces incubated at 30°C in a lab show mortality after less than 15 hours with impacts on medicinal compound provision.,Human action,Medium term,Warm water coral reef ecosystems
Fibres and other materials,"The main assets of this system are macro algae, consisting of red, brown and green algae, and micro algae, consisting of the blue-green algae (cyanobacteria), brown (diatoms) and dinoflagellates. Macro algae are multicellular and appear plant like while micro algae are unicellular species which exist individually, or in chains or groups, sometimes known as phytoplankton. All algae contain chlorophyll for photosynthesis and are aquatic species. The main service provided by this system is the provision of algal compounds, which are predominately extracted from seawater by marine algae. These compounds, when extracted, have a myriad of direct uses in medical and pharmacological applications and in further processing in the food and cosmetic industries. Compounds extracted from macroalgae have antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral properties which can be used in medicine while microalgae such as Spirulina platensis can be ingested directly as a human nutritional supplement. Carageenins extracted from Chondrus crispis, a micro algae, are widely used as gelling agents in the food industry. Underlying asset components include the brown algae, kelp, is widely harvested as it is rich in iodine and alginates (kelp-derived carbohydrates). The kelp components –flat or leaf-like structures known as blades, the holdfast which anchors the blades and the air-filled bladders which keep it close to the surface – are harvested from the seabed partly or totally depending on the technique used. Alginates are used in food and drink, cosmetics etc. The antimicrobial action of iodine means that it is commonly used as a disinfectant in medical procedures. Elemental iodine may also be used to treat iodine deficiency. Other macro algal components of this system are the carrageenans, which are polysaccharides extracted from red algae, and alginates from the brown algae. Both are used in the cosmetics and food industries principally as thickening agents. The main component of the micro algal asset, the cyanobacteria, are the pharmacologically active compounds from which antibiotics are extracted. These are used in antimicrobials, antivirals & antifungals, neuroprotective products, therapeutic proteins and drugs. Another component is the long chain polymers, present in the algae lipids, which are used for making bioplastics, biodegradable plastic alternative to those made from petroleum. The minimum conditions to maintain the service are sunlight and carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and water for nutrient extraction. Most green algae require moderate to bright light, while red and brown species will thrive in low to medium light levels. The optimum water temperature for two species of green algae, Chlorella ellipsoidea and Nannochloris oculata, is between 15 and 25°C while salinity levels of 15 to 30 parts per thousand are best for growth rate in the most commercially important green algae, Isochrysis galbana and Tetraselmis suecica.",Raw materials,Species,R,"There is a linear relationship between fibres and other materials from algae and species because a decrease in the algae would result in a decrease in the materials they provide.

It is well documented that strong winds and increased rainfall can subject species to biogenic habitat changes, nest destruction, invasive species introduction and saltwater intrusion, negatively impacting species survival in localised event contexts. Species that are highly susceptible are those that cannot shelter from wind effectively, that are liable to flooding, subject to habitat displacement (e.g. sand dune burrows), and migrating species. Historical records provide a degree of certainty that an increase in storm intensity and frequency will have an negative impact on many species overall, however, some species may benefit in the short term from storm activity, for example scavengers such as raccoons have been shown to benefit from storms. ",Detrital material produced by storms caused annual erosion of two species of kelp of between 0.5 and 1.7 kg dry weight per m2. Erosion rate was positively related to water temperature and site exposure.,Increased erosion of kelp blades by storms.

Fibres and other materials,"The assets underpinning the system are both wild and domestic plant species and (vegetated) habitats including farmlands and plantations. The service flow is maintained through the system by the provision of vegetable fibres from the system components – the roots, fruit, leaves, buds, seeds, and stems of plants. Other vegetable materials flow from the same components. Cellulose is the main ingredient of all vegetable fibres, while tannin is a common plant-based dyeing material. Underlying asset components include, plants convert light energy to chemical energy in a process called photosynthesis. Green components, i.e. green leaves, which are the primary photosynthetic organs enabling the production of cellulose, a carbohydrate stored in the bark, roots, wood or leaves of plants. Major uses are for paper, timber, fuel wood and charcoal, cotton etc.  Tannins are found in the same parts of the plant as well as other growing parts - buds, seeds, roots, and stem tissues. Photosynthetic efficiency determines the amount of biomass created, hence the growth rate of the plant and its component parts. Leaf health is a major determinant of the quality of all components of the plant species-based assets, both in wild and commercial species. Declines in leaf health impact the provision of the service. Pests and disease which consume only the woody parts, roots or fruits can reduce the quality of fibres and other materials they provide. Secondary chemical compounds (known as secondary metabolites) in plants form the basis of much of the world’s pharmaceutical industry - traditional and western medicines, and insecticides as well. These are organic compounds that play an important role in plant defense against herbivory and other interspecies defenses. Vegetated habitats such as forests, shrublands and grasslands support the plants that provide fibres, tannins and secondary compounds. The minimum conditions to maintain the service flow are healthy soil, adequate light and a water supply and an absence of alien invasive species (or plant diseases) which could outcompete plant species leading to reduction in survival.

Noise and ecological light pollution alters natural regimes in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and can affect foraging, orientation, reproduction, communication and other critical behaviours. Vegetation is the main (natural) barrier used to reduce noise and light pollution, limiting the impact it can have on human health and the environment.

Decreases in vegetation filtering services provided by photosynthesis and dry deposition, as a result of deforestation, has left the atmosphere highly susceptible to further increases. Extensive studies have shown that GHG exudation significantly increases radiative forcing, trapping heat within the atmosphere, contributing to global warming and altering convection currents and atmospheric pressures. Although GHG effects are predicted with high levels of certainty there is far greater uncertainty regarding the levels of aerosols and their impact on radiative forcing and the atmosphere, resulting in some variability in the effects of pollution on the atmosphere over time.

Pest control,"Pest control and invasive alien species management is provided through a range of natural assets. These include direct introduction and maintenance of populations of the predators of the pest or the invasive species, landscaping areas to encourage habitats for pest reduction, e.g. through habitat creation for their predators or planting relevant food plants or plants that flower and attract relevant insects, and the manufacture of a family of natural biocides (algicide, fungicide, herbicide, insecticide, molluscicide, pesticide) based on natural toxins to pests. In the marine realm, the cleansing of invasive species-laden ballast water, through its exchange at sea before port arrival, is the only widely practised remedy for invasive species management. This has however had limited success and has been responsible for the introduction of invasive species in the Baltic Sea where up to 13 species have been introduced via ballast or as attachments to the bottom of ships. Invasive species prevention, in a whole-ecosystem context, must take into account food web and functional role frameworks in order to maintain healthy interactions at different trophic levels. For example the removal of a native, grazing herbivore can heighten the risk of invasions of alien plants. Predator-prey interactions are a key component in pest management strategies, especially in agro-ecological systems. Habitat restoration is an important component. For example, remnant forest or planted woody vegetation adjacent to vineyards can increase predation of eggs of a vineyard insect pest, Epiphyas postvittana. Disturbed and non-restored habitats are more susceptible to colonisation by invasive species, e.g. human-made habitats such as farmland and urban landscapes also facilitate the spread of alien plants. Habitat characteristics, such as climate, soil nutrients, existing flora and human impact determine the habitat’s vulnerability to invasions. Mountains, cliffs, bogs, dry grasslands and coniferous woodlands tend to resist alien invasion, while coastal and riverine habitats, where nutrient availability and disturbance can be high, are more prone to invasion by alien plants. The minimum conditions to maintain pest control are limiting pathways for invasive species spread and maintaining predator-prey interactions. Pests and invasive species are particularly likely to spread in locations where there are few species and little competition (e.g. islands) or in locations of high turnover and instability (e.g. river margins, wetlands, coasts).",Ecosystem integrity,Habitats,A,There is a non-linear relationship between pest control and habitats as they are not directly directly linked. Pest control is sensitive to changes in habitats as these changes can create empty niches that allow invasions to occur. These changes could be reversed if habitats are restored. Habitats are a supporting asset for pest control as a service. There is low uncertainty in the relationship between pest control and habitats as there has been many studies. ,Habitat modification,A,"Habitat modification directly impacts habitats: altering landscapes and communities through reducing population sizes and fragmenting ranges by imposing physical or biological barriers to dispersal. Habitats are susceptible to the changes brought by habitat modifaction, however habitats vary in resilience - therefore impacts differ. The direct impacts of disturbance on habitats (e.g. tropical forests) are still uncertain.",Increase in non-native species,Changes in habitat characteristics facilitate non-native species which can outcompete native species creating more opportunities for pests.,Human action,Long term,Global
Pest control,"Pest control and invasive alien species management is provided through a range of natural assets. These include direct introduction and maintenance of populations of the predators of the pest or the invasive species, landscaping areas to encourage habitats for pest reduction, e.g. through habitat creation for their predators or planting relevant food plants or plants that flower and attract relevant insects, and the manufacture of a family of natural biocides (algicide, fungicide, herbicide, insecticide, molluscicide, pesticide) based on natural toxins to pests. In the marine realm, the cleansing of invasive species-laden ballast water, through its exchange at sea before port arrival, is the only widely practised remedy for invasive species management. This has however had limited success and has been responsible for the introduction of invasive species in the Baltic Sea where up to 13 species have been introduced via ballast or as attachments to the bottom of ships. Invasive species prevention, in a whole-ecosystem context, must take into account food web and functional role frameworks in order to maintain healthy interactions at different trophic levels. For example the removal of a native, grazing herbivore can heighten the risk of invasions of alien plants. Predator-prey interactions are a key component in pest management strategies, especially in agro-ecological systems. Habitat restoration is an important component. For example, remnant forest or planted woody vegetation adjacent to vineyards can increase predation of eggs of a vineyard insect pest, Epiphyas postvittana. Disturbed and non-restored habitats are more susceptible to colonisation by invasive species, e.g. human-made habitats such as farmland and urban landscapes also facilitate the spread of alien plants. Habitat characteristics, such as climate, soil nutrients, existing flora and human impact determine the habitat’s vulnerability to invasions. Mountains, cliffs, bogs, dry grasslands and coniferous woodlands tend to resist alien invasion, while coastal and riverine habitats, where nutrient availability and disturbance can be high, are more prone to invasion by alien plants. The minimum conditions to maintain pest control are limiting pathways for invasive species spread and maintaining predator-prey interactions. Pests and invasive species are particularly likely to spread in locations where there are few species and little competition (e.g. islands) or in locations of high turnover and instability (e.g. river margins, wetlands, coasts).",Ecosystem integrity,Species,R,There is a linear relationship between pest control and species as they are directly linked.

There is low uncertainty in the relationship between pest control and species because they are intrinsically linked.,Habitat modification,R,"Species distributions, abundance and dynamics are expected to worsen in the long term.The distribution and abundance of a species are governed by the birth, growth, death and dispersal rates of individuals comprising a population. These rates are also affected by land use.  Habitat modification often leads to fragmentation - where there is a loss of habitat, reduced patch size and an increasing distance between patches - but can also lead to an increase of new habitat. Degradation of habitat quality or quantity can reduce population size and growth rates and elevate the change of local extinction events - as such they are highly susceptible to impacts. Each system varies by location, and individual species vary greatly in their response to habitat modification.

Pollination,"Pollination refers to the movement of pollen from the male part of flowers (the stamens) to the female part that contains the ovules. Pollination services are provided by three main mechanisms: animals, water and wind. The majority of plants (90% of wild flowering plant species and 75% of global food crops) depend to some extent on animals that act as vectors, or pollinators, to perform the transfer of pollen. Wind- and water-mediated pollination do occur, however they are less efficient and are not primary mechanisms of pollination for plants. Wind plays a minor role in pollination of certain cereals, but it is important for almost all conifer species. Animal pollinators include species of insects, birds, mammals (e.g. bats, primates, marsupials, rodents), and reptiles. The largest group of pollinators is comprised of insects, of which bees are the most important. Over 90% of the world’s leading global crop types are visited by bees. Some bee species are managed by humans to enable pollination of certain crops, but the vast majority of pollinating bee species are wild (i.e. free-living and unmanaged). Pollination is a key ecosystem service for companies within the agricultural and luxury goods industries. The annual contribution of pollinators to the global economy equates to US$235 – 577 billion (using 2015 data). Underlying asset components include: healthy populations of wild and managed insects, birds, mammals, fish, and reptiles; wind processes for wind-based pollination; and water bodies for water-based pollination.

With increases in habitat modification projected, the composition of atmospheric gases and climate variability are expected to continue over the next 100 years. The atmosphere is therefore susceptible to the impacts of habitat modification. However, projections of habitat modification related to atmospheric changes can be highly variable due to unexpected events and climate shock induced spikes in CO2 releases creating uncertainty in projections (e.g. drought associated forest fires in indonesia 2016).

There is low uncertainty in the relationship between pollination and species because they are intrinsically linked.,Intensive agriculture and aquaculture,R,"Agricultural activities such as tillage, drainage, intercropping, rotation, grazing and extensive use of pesticides and fertilisers have significant implications for wild species. Aquaculture has some positive impacts on biodiversity - it can reduce pressure on overexploited wild stocks and enhance depleted stocks, and can boost natural production and species diversity. However, species that escape from aquaculture can become invasive in areas where they are not native; effluents from aquaculture can cause eutrophication; ecologically sensitive land may be converted for aquaculture use; aquaculture species may consume scarce fish meal; and aquaculture may transmit diseases to wild fish. Species are generally expected to worsen in the short term. Impacts of intensive agriculture and aquaculture to species varies, but is well researched.","Management of pollinators for commercial purposes, mass breeding, and trade have exacerbated the impacts of pathogens and pests on pollinator species. Further reductions in species survival.",Decreased pollination services,Human action,Short term - Impacts have occurred in the past and are occurring and materialise within a matter of days to months.,Local - Impacts will materialise where pathogens and pests are prevalent and will be more severe when they affect less resilient pollinators.
Pollination,"Pollination refers to the movement of pollen from the male part of flowers (the stamens) to the female part that contains the ovules. Pollination services are provided by three main mechanisms: animals, water and wind. The majority of plants (90% of wild flowering plant species and 75% of global food crops) depend to some extent on animals that act as vectors, or pollinators, to perform the transfer of pollen. Wind- and water-mediated pollination do occur, however they are less efficient and are not primary mechanisms of pollination for plants. Wind plays a minor role in pollination of certain cereals, but it is important for almost all conifer species. Animal pollinators include species of insects, birds, mammals (e.g. bats, primates, marsupials, rodents), and reptiles. The largest group of pollinators is comprised of insects, of which bees are the most important. Over 90% of the world’s leading global crop types are visited by bees. Some bee species are managed by humans to enable pollination of certain crops, but the vast majority of pollinating bee species are wild (i.e. free-living and unmanaged).

Invasive species can also facilitate native species through habitat modification (through acting as habitat engineers), pollination, competitive release and predatory release. These interactions can occur in a wide range of habitats, and different species have variability in their effect. The effects of invasive species are often difficult to detect or occur after long time lags - as such there is uncertainty in their impact.

Vertebrate pests can also cause huge economic losses to agriculture, and need to be appropriately managed. Species are impacted differently by pests - some have greater resilience than others, due to their life parameters (e.g. survival rates etc.).

Soils host biotic agents that drive weathering. Weathering processes do not operate in isolation, it is a complex coupling of physico-chemical and biological processes. Sensitivity of weathering to changes in soil will depend on properties changed, and type of parent material. For processes dependent on soil, these will most like be also driven by biological and other agents of chemical weathering therefore the service has medium sensitivity to loss of soils as an asset.

There is medium uncertainty in the relationship.",Weather conditions,A,"Soils and sediments can be dried out and rearranged during windy weather. As soil is dried out, plant growth is reduced, which reduces the stability of the surface layer and leads to erosion. Desertification is a more extreme version of this process, where soils that lose stable plant communities become unstable themselves, and subsequently start to shift around. In contrast, increases in precipitation can cause changes to soil texture and structure, with increases in run-off causing reduction in top soil (which is often the most productive part of a soil horizon).

Surface water,"Surface water is provided through freshwater resources from collected precipitation and water flow from natural sources. Surface water is a key resource for many industries, including most notably the agriculture, energy production and tourism industries.

Ventilation,"The process of water moving through the plant and back out into the atmosphere is called transpiration.

It is an essential part of the global water cycle, accounting for about 10 percent of the moisture found in the atmosphere.

Water flow maintenance,"The hydrological cycle, also called water cycle or hydrologic cycle, is the system that enables circulation of water through the Earth’s atmosphere, land, and oceans.

The effects are not uniform across the globe due to an interplay between surface ocean heat distribution and atmospheric heat re-distribution, resulting in high variability in the response of weather patterns to atmospheric and surface temperature changes.
